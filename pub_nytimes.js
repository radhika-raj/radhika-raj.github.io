Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThousands of parents \u2014 liberal, conservative and everything in between \u2014 face tough decisions when a child declares that he or she is transgender, particularly when that child showed no sign of gender dysphoria in his or her early years. Unfortunately, this issue, like so many in our country, has been politicized. The edict by Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas to investigate parents for child abuse if they provide certain medical treatment to their transgender children was radical and divisive. A Texas court ruled on March 11 that the policy had been improperly adopted and violated the State Constitution. Amid the political posturing, allowing children to alter their bodies through lifelong medical treatment is worth an analytical conversation. Parents worldwide are grappling over how to prevent their children from starting down the road of hormone treatment, which has lifelong side effects. Many feel isolated and powerless while schools, therapists, gender specialists and others encourage gender transition. Many believe that children, perhaps too young to understand the implications of medical decisions, are swept up in a social movement.\n\nThe problem is we can\u2019t seem to talk about this issue without making it political. By telling Texas child care services to prioritize investigating parents helping their kids get transgender therapy instead of investigating actual cases of serious child abuse, Gov. Greg Abbott proved that his top priority is not to help children in danger, but to boost his appeal among trans- and gay-hating constituents in order to gain the Republican presidential nomination. What a cold and callous man. Is this really the kind of person any party would want in high office? I hope not, but that he was elected governor of Texas is a chilling confirmation of how equally cold and callous his supporters can be. Here\u2019s yet another narcissistic politician aiming for the White House by sneering at the law and attacking those who are different. America is better than this! As a pediatrician who has taken care of transgender patients and who trained at UT Southwestern Medical Center and Children\u2019s Medical Center of Dallas, I think the decision to close the clinic flies in the face of all that is known about the care of children with the diagnosis of gender dysphoria and the recommendations of experts in the field. I have seen firsthand the benefits that the multidisciplinary care that clinics like Genecis provide. The clinic\u2019s closure undoubtedly will result in needless suffering for its patients and other children who could have obtained care there. It appears that administrators have responded to the demands of poorly informed anti-trans partisans rather than the best science and evidence.\n\nRe \u201cThis \u2018Don\u2019t Say Gay\u2019 Bill Will Hurt Teenagers Like Me\u201d (Opinion guest essay, March 15): Will Larkins\u2019s clarion cri de coeur on behalf of gay and gender-nonconforming teenagers touched me deeply. It also brought to mind a long-dormant memory: In 1990, when I was a sophomore in high school, I submitted an essay about a boy I liked. When my English teacher, Mr. Coyle, handed it back to me, I saw that he had added in his unprepossessing red scrawl the dreaded \u201cSee me after class.\u201d When the last of my classmates had filed out, I approached the big desk at the front of the room and, in a small voice, offered, \u201cYou wanted to see me?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Mr. Coyle said, pointing to my paper. \u201cAre you OK with this? Because I am.\u201d Eight words I could not have gotten at home. Eight words that saved my life. Mr. Coyle has since died, lost too soon to Alzheimer\u2019s, but he lives on in the spirit of Henry Adams\u2019s words: \u201cA teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops.\u201d", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://khanna.house.gov/media/press-releases/release-reps-ro-khanna-barbara-lee-and-andy-kim-introduces-resolution-calling", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/12/opinion/florida-dont-say-gay-bill.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/us/texas-transgender-child-abuse.html", "https://quincyinst.org/2020/12/21/its-time-to-end-the-korean-war/", "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022002720972180", "https://www.cato.org/commentary/peace-declaration-end-korean-war-idea-whose-time-has-come#", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/14/opinion/north-korea.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/health/texas-transgender-clinic-genecis-abbott.html"], "labels": [{"name": "Opinion"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Texas child care services", "weight": 0.091065414}, {"name": "child abuse", "weight": 0.08865149}, {"name": "serious child abuse", "weight": 0.08610396}, {"name": "other children", "weight": 0.085599355}, {"name": "children", "weight": 0.08544584}, {"name": "lifelong medical treatment", "weight": 0.074743815}, {"name": "gender dysphoria", "weight": 0.07312532}, {"name": "certain medical treatment", "weight": 0.07269848}, {"name": "gender transition", "weight": 0.06993563}, {"name": "medical decisions", "weight": 0.06907899}], "topics": [{"name": "LGBTQ"}, {"name": "Social Issues"}, {"name": "Trans Rights"}, {"name": "Texas"}], "categories": [{"name": "Politics"}], "entities": [{"data": "Greg Abbott", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Will Larkins\u2019s", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Coyle", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Henry Adams\u2019s", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Texas", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "America", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Dallas", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the State Constitution", "type": "LAW", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Republican", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the White House", "type": "FAC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "UT Southwestern Medical Center", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Children\u2019s Medical Center", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Genecis", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "English", "type": "LANGUAGE", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.026683008, "negative": 0.65233785, "neutral": 0.3209791}, "summary": "The edict by Gov.

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAfter transitioning in private, they are preparing to return to the workplace at a time when gender identity itself is a politically divisive issue.\n\nFor years, Deke Wilson, 41, was ambivalent about undergoing a medical transition to male. He felt it was critical for his happiness, but there were plenty of reasons to put it off: the expense, the difficult recovery, the potential medical complications. But while sitting at home during the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Wilson said he felt the urgency. \u201cYou\u2019re trying so hard to avoid getting this one sickness,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy? Because you want to live \u2014 you want to experience life fully to the best you can. For me, that means being comfortable in my skin.\u201d Mr. Wilson, who works at a logistics company in Cleveland, underwent five surgeries from March through December last year at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, recovering while working from home. He expects to return to in-person work this month. For some transgender people, the era of remote work during the pandemic provided an opportunity to take the next steps in their transitions, according to interviews with more than 30 transgender people, their doctors and advocates.\n\nData on medical transitions during the pandemic remains hard to come by, although anecdotal evidence from the interviews suggests an increase in surgeries compared to previous years. No database tracks the total number of people in the United States who undergo medical transitions each year, but seven regional and local health care providers reported stronger demand for transition operations in 2021, compared to 2020, when many surgeries were paused because of the pandemic. Demand was also higher in 2021 compared to 2019, before the pandemic. While some of the increase can be attributed to operations that were postponed while hospitals were overwhelmed by Covid-19 patients, doctors in the field offered other explanations as well. They note that more employers are covering transgender health care in insurance plans, that surgical techniques are becoming safer and resulting in better cosmetic outcomes, and that more hospitals are offering these services to patients. For example, Mount Sinai, which has the biggest transgender care program in New York City \u2014 the Center for Transgender Medicine and Surgery \u2014 has also seen an increase. It performed 938 surgeries in 2021, 60 percent more than the previous year and 43 percent more than 2019. \u201cWe\u2019ve been scrambling to have the bandwidth for the people who are feeling comfortable who are coming in for care,\u201d said Dr. Joshua Safer, the center\u2019s executive director.\n\nAt Northwell Health\u2019s Center for Transgender Care in New York, which was founded in 2016, the number of transition procedures roughly doubled in 2021, compared with the number of surgeries in 2020, which was similar to the number in 2019, according to Dr. David W. Rosenthal, the center\u2019s medical director. Many transgender people do not feel that costly surgery is necessary. For those who do seek medical transitions, common surgeries include chest reconstructions, genital reconstructions, hairline lifts, lip lifts and removing or adding Adam\u2019s apples. Even as access to transgender medical care has increased, the subject remains a political and cultural flashpoint in the United States, where Americans are roughly evenly split over whether they believe others should be allowed to legally switch their sex, according to a YouGov poll published in September. These tensions also play out in the workplace, despite efforts at greater inclusion by some employers, although research into the experiences of the estimated 1.4 million transgender people in the United States is limited. A McKinsey report published in November found that transgender employees earn 32 percent less than the rest of the population, even when they have similar or higher levels of education. Nearly two-thirds of transgender employees in the United States remain in the closet in some or all professional interactions with clients or customers, out of fears that they will experience hostility, harassment or discomfort. Transgender adults are twice as likely as other adults to be unemployed, the report found.\n\nWorking from home during the pandemic was a welcome reprieve. She had time to herself to think about what changes she wanted to make to her life, and what was stopping her from undergoing facial feminization surgery. When Samsung added coverage for transition surgeries in 2021, she said she was overjoyed. Ms. Mack said she had struggled all her life with gender dysphoria, a medical term that refers to the distress or discomfort that occurs when one\u2019s gender identity does not align with the sex assigned at birth. She recovered from her two facial feminization surgeries at Northwell Health in 2021 while working from home, turning her camera off during some calls. Her angst has since lifted, she said. Now, she said, \u201cI can, without makeup on, just be grubbing it \u2014 not wearing earrings, not wearing jewelry \u2014 and just walk into a women\u2019s bathroom and not worry, and that has been the most freeing thing on this planet.\u201d Even in the most liberal cities and workplaces, many people are clearly perplexed or feel threatened by efforts at inclusiveness focused on identity, as well as by changes in culture and language, from acronyms to preferred pronouns. David Baboolall, an associate partner at McKinsey who co-wrote its transgender report and who, as a transgender person, uses the pronoun \u201cthey,\u201d said that corporate diversity training programs sometimes focus on the experiences of gay people while glossing over the experiences of transgender or nonbinary people, they said. \u201cOur experience gets erased or ignored because people simply don\u2019t have the vocabulary to talk about it, or they\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll cause offense by getting the words they do actually know wrong,\u201d they said. \u201cTo craft more inclusive policies, it\u2019s important to understand that education is so important here.\u201d Part of creating an inclusive working environment means investing in employee affinity groups and creating guides for managers, several transgender and gender-fluid people said in interviews.\n\n\u201cGoing back into work now feels really difficult,\u201d said Ms. Lee, who has returned to in-person teaching and still presents as masculine at work. She said she sometimes wonders why it took her so long to come out to those closest to her. \u201cAll those fears I had, everything that was holding me back about transitioning, it doesn\u2019t make sense anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I could be happy like this.\u201d Mr. Wilson, the man who underwent five transition surgeries while working remotely, said he was somewhat nervous about going back to the office, but also thrilled about feeling comfortable in his own body. He expected his colleagues to be supportive, as they were when he came out to them in December 2019, but he anticipated questions about his new facial hair and increased muscle mass. \u201cI\u2019m a little excited for people to see the changes,\u201d he said.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/being-transgender-at-work?cid=other-eml-dre-mip-mck&hlkid=bdeb6a98a3d9412e98fd81fdd3ba4e19&hctky=2851971&hdpid=c13da393-3298-4f18-8faf-e78134579724", "https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2021/09/23/americans-transgender-survey", "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/01/us/terminology-language-politics.html"], "labels": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "transition surgeries", "weight": 0.07877188}, {"name": "Many transgender people", "weight": 0.07836516}, {"name": "transgender medical care", "weight": 0.07634342}, {"name": "medical transitions", "weight": 0.069231644}, {"name": "transgender health care", "weight": 0.069093}, {"name": "many surgeries", "weight": 0.066155724}, {"name": "transgender employees", "weight": 0.06564826}, {"name": "facial feminization surgery", "weight": 0.06448786}, {"name": "Transgender adults", "weight": 0.06291093}, {"name": "many people", "weight": 0.06281264}], "topics": [{"name": "LGBTQ"}, {"name": "Social Issues"}, {"name": "Trans Rights"}], "categories": [{"name": "Business"}], "entities": [{"data": "Deke Wilson", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Joshua Safer", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "David W.

In addition to investigating them without exception, she said, the agency\u2019s staff was told to not put anything about the cases in writing.\n\n\u201cThese are not being treated the same,\u201d Ms. Mulanax said during the hearing on Friday in a state district court in Austin. \u201cWe had to be investigating these cases.\u201d Ms. Mulanax\u2019s testimony came at the start of a hearing on Friday, in front of Judge Amy Clark Meachum in Travis County, over whether investigations into families with transgender children should be halted statewide. The case began with a legal challenge last week by the parents of a 16-year-old transgender girl. The parents were among the first to be investigated under Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s order, which directed state officials to start abuse investigations into parents who provide hormones or puberty-suppressing drugs to their transgender children. The teenager\u2019s mother, an employee of the family protective agency, has remained anonymous in court filings, and is referred to only as Jane Doe. Wearing a wig and glasses, the mother testified on Friday about the details of the investigation into her family and the emotional toll it has taken on them. Judge Meachum temporarily stopped the investigation into the family last week, but allowed others in the state to continue while she considered broader action.\n\nMs. Mulanax, a witness for the plaintiffs, described a virtual meeting of senior leaders last month in which they discussed the handling of investigations under the governor\u2019s order, which was issued on Feb. 22. She said she and others were told not to put information about the cases in email or text messages \u2014 instructions that she said were highly unusual in her years of experience at the agency. \u201cHave you ever been told not to put information on cases in writing?\u201d asked Brian Klosterboer, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cWhat did you make of the instruction to not put anything in writing?\u201d \u201cIt was very unethical,\u201d said Ms. Mulanax. Limiting trans care. Republicans in Texas are seeking to criminalize medical treatments that help align trans teens\u2019 bodies with their gender identities. Here is what to know about the efforts: Failed bills. Texas has repeatedly considered bills that would have banned gender-affirming treatment for teenagers, yet all have so far failed. One proposal sought to redefine child abuse to include gender-affirming treatment for transgender children. An opinion and an order. Attorney General Ken Paxton recently issued an opinion stating that providing treatments like puberty-suppressing drugs to transgender teenagers should be investigated as child abuse. Shortly after, Gov. Abbott reaffirmed the notion in a letter to state health agencies. Investigations begin. While Gov. Abbott\u2019s order doesn\u2019t change Texas law, the state\u2019s child welfare agency has begun investigating child abuse claims related to trans care. On March 2, a state court temporarily halted the investigation of one family, but allowed others to continue. The pushback. Transgender health experts have condemned the attempt to limit trans care, and some attorneys have said they would not prosecute families of transgender children for child abuse under the new definition. Several major businesses signed onto an ad campaign protesting the governor\u2019s order. The state Department of Family and Protective Services has struggled for years to care for children in its foster care system and to conduct investigations into child abuse. The agency has been the subject of a decade-old federal lawsuit over its foster care system, in which children faced abuse as well as long waits to be adopted or placed in safer homes. Federal monitors have been overseeing the implementation of judicial orders since 2019, among them a directive to improve the handling and investigation of reported child abuse.\n\nA federal court held an emergency hearing on Thursday, unrelated to the fight over transgender children, regarding a report of an agency employee who has been accused of sex trafficking, abuse and neglect of children at a foster care facility in Bastrop, Texas, that is under contract to the state. Mr. Abbott called the report \u201cabhorrent\u201d in a statement, and said that \u201cchild abuse of any kind won\u2019t be tolerated in the state of Texas.\u201d During cross-examination at the hearing on Friday, a lawyer for the state said that Ms. Mulanax\u2019s job at the agency was to apply the law regarding child abuse, which the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, had determined in a nonbinding legal opinion included medical treatments for transgender youth. The state\u2019s lawyer, Courtney Corbel, asked whether any major steps had been taken as a result of the investigations into parents of transgender children. Had any child been taken away from their parents, she asked. Had a child been taken off medication prescribed by a doctor? \u201cI\u2019m not aware of that,\u201d she said. Ms. Mulanax said that she had decided to resign because of the governor\u2019s order. \u201cI have always felt that the department has the children\u2019s best interest at heart,\u201d she said. \u201cI no longer feel that way with this order.\u201d", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/us/texas-transgender-child-abuse.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-texas-trans-youth&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/23/science/texas-abbott-transgender-child-abuse.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/health/texas-transgender-clinic-genecis-abbott.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-texas-trans-youth&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/us/texas-transgender-child-abuse.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/23/science/texas-abbott-transgender-child-abuse.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-texas-trans-youth&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/us/texas-transgender-youth-medical-care-abuse.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-texas-trans-youth&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/us/texas-child-abuse-trans-youth.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/health/transgender-teens-hormones.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-texas-trans-youth&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc", "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/10/us/politics/businesses-texas-trans-teens-child-abuse.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-texas-trans-youth&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc"], "labels": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "child abuse", "weight": 0.13128947}, {"name": "transgender children", "weight": 0.12872417}, {"name": "Child abuse investigators", "weight": 0.12351592}, {"name": "reported child abuse", "weight": 0.12263616}, {"name": "child abuse claims", "weight": 0.1224831}, {"name": "children", "weight": 0.11073742}, {"name": "child welfare", "weight": 0.10862269}, {"name": "abuse investigations", "weight": 0.10559464}, {"name": "abuse", "weight": 0.084432}, {"name": "state health agencies", "weight": 0.08315132}], "topics": [{"name": "Crime"}, {"name": "LGBTQ"}, {"name": "Social Issues"}, {"name": "Trans Rights"}, {"name": "Texas"}], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "Austin", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "HOUSTON", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Texas", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 7}, {"data": "Travis County", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Bastrop", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Abbott", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Randa Mulanax", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 9}, {"data": "Amy Clark Meachum", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Jane Doe", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Brian Klosterboer", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ken Paxton", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Courtney Corbel", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Department of Family and Protective Services", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "the American Civil Liberties Union", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Republicans", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.017766975, "negative": 0.71847916, "neutral": 0.26375386}, "summary": "\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 Child abuse investigators in Texas have been told to prioritize cases involving the parents of transgender children and to investigate them without exception, after the state\u2019s governor ordered certain medical care to be treated as abuse, an investigations supervisor said during a court hearing on Friday.

In describing Transy House, the Brooklyn rowhouse where she had sheltered transgender people who would have otherwise been homeless, she likened herself to a mother bird.\n\nMs. Moore, a business professor, sheltered hundreds of people, including the activist Sylvia Rivera, in her Park Slope home, which came to be known as Transy House.\n\nRusty Mae Moore, a transgender educator and activist who housed hundreds of transgender people in the 1990s and 2000s in her Brooklyn home, a de facto shelter that became known as Transy House, died on Feb. 23 at her home in Pine Hill, N.Y., in the Catskills. She was 80. Her wife, Chelsea Goodwin, said the cause was cardiovascular complications. Ms. Moore, a longtime professor of international business, was a fixture in New York City\u2019s transgender community. After she transitioned in the early 1990s, she purchased a rowhouse in the Park Slope neighborhood, where she sheltered up to a dozen people at a time who would have otherwise been homeless. Among them were Sylvia Rivera, herself an important figure in New York\u2019s transgender history, who stayed with Ms. Moore for more than a decade, taking on a motherly role by doling out wisdom, advice and loans to other residents. Transy House was modeled after a shelter Ms. Rivera had run with Marsha P. Johnson in the 1970s through their organization Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries, first in a trailer truck in Greenwich Village and later in a former tenement building in the East Village. \u201cSometimes you\u2019re generous with material things \u2014 and Rusty spent a lot of money taking care of people she didn\u2019t have to take care of,\u201d Mariah Lopez, the executive director of the Strategic Trans Alliance for Radical Reform, who lived in Transy House for three years, said in a phone interview. \u201cBut she was an unbelievably kind person.\u201d\n\nMs. Lopez said that Ms. Moore\u2019s knowledge and wisdom often stuck with residents long after they had moved on. \u201cRusty made me understand that we have been around for a long time, and she gave me a pride deeper than a fight,\u201d she added. \u201cA pride in being transgender related to the beauty of being trans.\u201d\n\nRusty Mae Moore was born on Oct. 25, 1941, in Sewickley, Pa., near Pittsburgh, and grew up in nearby Aliquippa. Her mother, Mary (Long) Moore, worked as an elementary-school teacher, and her father, Paul Martin Moore, owned a car dealership. Rusty attended public schools in Aliquippa until her junior year of high school, when she transferred to West Nottingham Academy, a boarding school in Colora, Md. There, her family said, she became captain of the school\u2019s football, basketball and baseball teams and graduated as class valedictorian.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Ms. Moore moved to Evanston, Ill., to attend Northwestern University. She studied business with a minor in Russian studies. While at Northwestern, Ms. Moore met Nancy Voigt Wedemeyer; they married in 1963. Soon after, they moved to Medford, Mass., where Ms. Moore received master\u2019s and doctoral degrees in law and diplomacy at Tufts University. While earning her doctorate, she worked on and off at Rockwell International in Detroit, taught at a Brazilian business school and worked at General Motors in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Her first child, Jonica, was born in Brazil. After completing her Ph.D. in 1969, she spent a semester teaching at Arizona State University before accepting a job as a business professor at the University of Texas at Austin. While working there, Ms. Moore and her wife divorced, and Ms. Wedemeyer decided to remain in Texas with their daughter. Ms. Moore returned to the Northeast in 1974, accepting a job as a business professor at New York University. She married Sara Lee Zug in 1978. They had a daughter, Amanda, that year and a son, Colin, in 1983. Ms. Moore began teaching at Hofstra University, on Long Island, in 1979. She was the associate dean of Hofstra\u2019s business school from 1982 until 1985 and director of the Hofstra University Business Research Institute until 1991. She was a Fulbright fellow in Brazil at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro in 1986 and 1987. Fluent in six languages, she also spent semesters teaching in Russia and the Netherlands. She continued to teach at Hofstra until 2011. Ms. Moore and Ms. Zug separated in the early 1990s and later divorced. In 1992, Ms. Moore began attending a transgender support group in Lower Manhattan; soon after that, she came out to her family and returned to her classroom as Rusty Mae.\n\n\u201cShe shared that as a child she felt she was in the wrong gender, which she really noticed when she dressed up as a girl for Halloween when she was 13,\u201d her daughter Jonica wrote in an email. \u201cLike something out of the movies, our eyes locked and I swear I could hear the corny music,\u201d Ms. Goodwin said. Ms. Goodwin moved in with Ms. Moore on Long Island, and the couple transitioned alongside each other and a transgender roommate, Julia Murray. In 1994, Ms. Moore bought a rowhouse at 214 16th Street in Park Slope. She and Ms. Goodwin soon opened it up to anyone in need, knowing that government-run shelters often discriminated against transgender people. \u201cWe very quickly started allowing otherwise homeless trans people to crash with us,\u201d Ms. Goodwin said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t trying to set up an institution or anything, but Rusty could relate, and so could I, to the old idea of a hippie crash pad that was a safe place you could go.\u201d \u201cWe were taking in trans people that were between housing situations,\u201d she added, \u201cwhich, with discrimination and so forth being what they were in those days, was quite often.\u201d In 2008, Ms. Moore and Ms. Goodwin bought a house in Pine Hill. Ms. Moore continued to commute between the Catskills, Brooklyn and Hofstra until she retired in 2011 and moved upstate permanently.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/20/nyregion/sylvia-rivera-50-figure-in-birth-of-the-gay-liberation-movement.html", "https://www.villagepreservation.org/2020/10/29/revolutionaries-on-east-second-street-the-star-house/", "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/obituaries/overlooked-marsha-p-johnson.html", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAdc-D8iZtI", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/movies/the-death-and-life-of-marsha-p-johnson-review.html", "https://www.nyclgbtsites.org/site/transy-house/"], "labels": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Ms. Moore", "weight": 0.08631761}, {"name": "transgender people", "weight": 0.076584876}, {"name": "Greenwich Village", "weight": 0.072864875}, {"name": "Ms. Goodwin", "weight": 0.06990451}, {"name": "Rusty Mae Moore", "weight": 0.06978957}, {"name": "Ms. Zug", "weight": 0.06952996}, {"name": "Ms. Wedemeyer", "weight": 0.06906883}, {"name": "Hofstra University", "weight": 0.06797203}, {"name": "Ms. Rivera", "weight": 0.06788258}, {"name": "Ms. Lopez", "weight": 0.066056155}], "topics": [{"name": "New York"}, {"name": "Academia"}, {"name": "Activism"}, {"name": "In Memoriam"}, {"name": "LGBTQ"}, {"name": "Social Issues"}, {"name": "Trans Rights"}], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "Rusty Mae Moore", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 24}, {"data": "Sylvia Rivera", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Chelsea Goodwin", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Marsha P.

While she followed the advice of their children\u2019s doctor to affirm the child\u2019s desire to dress as a girl, grow long hair and be known as Luna, Mr. Younger steadfastly objected. He resisted the new name, insisting instead on boys\u2019 clothes, short haircuts and the name the couple had chosen at birth. What began in a single household in a small community outside Dallas became a very public custody battle between Mr. Younger and Dr. Anne Georgulas, transforming him into a folk hero among conservatives and amplifying a growing effort to roll back transgender protections in statehouses across America. It paved the way, too, for an order late last month by Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas to investigate parents for child abuse if they provide certain medical treatments to their transgender children.\n\nThe abuse investigations ordered by Mr. Abbott, the first of their kind, represent the peak of a new round of action in state capitals aimed at transgender Americans, the most significant push by groups opposed to transgender rights since the national campaign to limit bathroom access foundered in 2017 and 2018. On Tuesday, a bill passed the Idaho House that would make medical treatments for transgender youth a felony, punishable by life in prison. But few predicted that it would go as far as it has in Texas. The directive by Mr. Abbott very quickly resulted in investigations by the Department of Family and Protective Services, prompted a major Houston hospital to restrict its care for transgender children and raised fears among civil rights advocates of copycat efforts in other states. President Biden has condemned the action and asked federal authorities to step in if cases of discrimination arise.\n\nThe fight over transgender issues, waged on several fronts in recent years, has increasingly focused on medical treatments for children. Major medical groups \u2014 along with transgender advocates \u2014 back what is known as gender-affirming care, which involves supporting a child\u2019s gender identity and social transition, often through clothes or a name. Such care can also eventually include puberty-blockers or hormone treatments, though surgery is not recommended for children. While acknowledging some uncertainty and risk, they cite evidence that the approach can improve children\u2019s mental health and reduce suicide. Opponents \u2014 including some large conservative organizations \u2014 argue that children are too young to decide for themselves and must be shielded from potentially life-altering treatments that have only recently gained broader acceptance among the medical community. Those at the center of the conservative push for new state laws include a coalition of familiar groups \u2014 the Heritage Foundation, Family Policy Alliance and Alliance Defending Freedom \u2014 that came together in the last two years. Then last month, a newer player on the right, American Principles Project, took up the cause in Texas, spending more than $600,000 to run a series of highly produced ads on cable television featuring the case of Mr. Younger, who has become an outspoken supporter of restrictive legislation on transgender issues. The ads directly targeted Mr. Abbott during a hard-fought Republican primary, accusing the governor of not taking steps to \u201cprotect our children.\u201d By that point, Mr. Younger, 57, had testified repeatedly at the Capitol in Austin on measures to restrict transgender medical treatments. After the bills failed, he entered the Republican primary for an open seat in the Texas House of Representatives. Last week, Mr. Younger came in second place, qualifying for the May runoff. For conservative activists, the legislative push has been part of a broader national struggle over social issues, including legislation in Florida to ban teaching about gender identity in schools. Some of the same activists who defend the rights of parents in battles over school curriculum argue that, on the question of transgender treatment, children need protection from their own parents.\n\nBut for many families in Texas, the threat of an investigation by the state has introduced new fears into an already challenging set of medical decisions. Children now worry that classmates or teachers could report their parents for possible abuse. Some families have taken steps to leave the state. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of looking over our shoulder a little bit,\u201d said Autumn Tupper, 43, of Frisco, Texas, a Dallas suburb. Because of the governor\u2019s directive, her son, Orion, 17, who came out as transgender over the last year, decided to delay gender-affirming hormone treatment until he turns 18 this summer. The deeper roots of the current fight over transgender rights in Texas can be traced to a 2015 battle in Houston over a local anti-discrimination ordinance, which would have applied to a range of protected classes, including race, age and gender identity. Opponents rallied around the notion that the bill would put women in danger by allowing men to enter women\u2019s bathrooms, dubbing it the \u201cbathroom ordinance.\u201d Its defeat helped clear the way for a national conservative push to enact so-called bathroom bills aimed at transgender people. But the bathroom effort stumbled. The one measure that passed, in North Carolina, was later repealed. In Texas, many social conservatives were angered at the state\u2019s failure to pass such a law.\n\n\u201cThis issue is not going to go away,\u201d Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a firebrand former talk radio host, said at the time, in 2017. By the next year, the custody case between Mr. Younger and Dr. Georgulas, in the Dallas suburb of Coppell, began to attract notice in conservative circles. There have been other such cases of parents fighting over the gender identity of their children. But Mr. Younger sought attention with a website and a campaign that featured the birth name of his child. Among the first articles on the case appeared in The Federalist in 2018. Mr. Younger sat for many interviews, including with Infowars. \u201cYou cannot understand the political situation in Texas without understanding my political advocacy,\u201d Mr. Younger said in a 16-minute call with The New York Times in which he refused to answer questions. \u201cYou work for an evil and wicked organization,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you\u2019ll use accuracy against my own values.\u201d\n\nThe governor took note. Then the attorney general, Ken Paxton, facing a tough primary fight, issued an opinion that puberty-blocking drugs or hormone treatments could be considered child abuse under existing law in Texas. Mr. Abbott, who was facing his own primary in days amid a barrage of American Principles Project ads, quickly directed the child protection agency to begin investigations. Among the first to be investigated was an employee of the agency. The investigation was temporarily halted by a court in Austin last week. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand the treatment; they think it\u2019s always surgery and it\u2019s happening on children,\u201d said Chase Strangio, deputy director for transgender justice at the American Civil Liberties Union, which sued to stop the investigations along with Lambda Legal. Opponents, he added, have been \u201cweaponizing the confusion.\u201d Mr. Abbott\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. But his top campaign strategist told reporters last week that the issue of \u201cgenital mutilation\u201d was a political winner. \u201cThere\u2019s this sense, especially among conservatives, that they\u2019re losing their country,\u201d said Terry Schilling, president of the American Principles Project. \u201cIt was just a few years ago that we were debating gay marriage, and now we\u2019re debating sex changes for minors. I mean, that\u2019s exponential movement in terms of culture.\u201d", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.ncsl.org/research/education/-bathroom-bill-legislative-tracking635951130.aspx",

Greg Abbott\u2019s move to investigate parents of transgender youth for child abuse. Then, they will engage in a Big Paper conversation to discuss the issue.\n\nFeatured Article: \u201cTexas Investigates Parents Over Care for Transgender Youth, Suit Says\u201d by J. David Goodman and Amanda Morris Last week, Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, wrote a letter to the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services stating that medical treatments provided to transgender adolescents, widely considered to be the standard of care in medicine, should be classified as \u201cchild abuse\u201d under existing state law. This week the state\u2019s Department of Family and Protective Services have begun investigating parents of transgender adolescents for possible child abuse. In this lesson, you will learn about the investigation and responses for and against the governor\u2019s action. Then, you will reflect on the article and engage in a classroom discussion about the issue. The piece you\u2019re about to read concerns transgender youth, and a new push by the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, to investigate medical treatments for them as \u201cchild abuse.\u201d What do you know about the experiences of transgender youth, either in your own community or more widely in your city or country? Before you read about what\u2019s happening in Texas, take a few minutes to answer that question in a journal.\n\nNext, think about your reaction to what Governor Abbott has told state health agencies. A Feb. 23 Times article explained the new requirements this way: Gov. Greg Abbott told state health agencies in Texas on Tuesday that medical treatments provided to transgender adolescents, widely considered to be the standard of care in medicine, should be classified as \u201cchild abuse\u201d under existing state law. His statements, made in a letter to the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, followed an opinion on Friday by Attorney General Ken Paxton that said providing medical treatments like puberty-suppressing drugs and hormones to transgender teenagers should be investigated as child abuse. Governor Abbott specified that the reporting requirements applied to \u201call licensed professionals who have direct contact with children who may be subject to such abuse, including doctors, nurses, and teachers, and provides criminal penalties for failure to report such child abuse.\u201d What is your reaction to this directive? Add it to the writing you have already done in your journal. Later in the lesson, you\u2019ll have a chance to revisit what you wrote. Read the article, then answer the following questions: 1. Who have Texas officials begun investigating? For what reason? What does the investigation of an employee of the state protective services agency who has a 16-year-old transgender child tell us about what these investigations might involve? 2. How are some county attorneys and district attorneys responding to Mr. Abbott\u2019s order? What are the possible ramifications of this order? 3. How are licensed professionals who have direct contact with children \u2014 including doctors, nurses and teachers \u2014 implicated under the new order? What is your reaction to this? 4. What actions have the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and Lambda Legal taken in response? What are they arguing?\n\n5. What is significant about the timing of Mr. Abbott\u2019s letter and Attorney General Ken Paxton\u2019s opinion? 6. How have critics of the order, including Paul Castillo, senior counsel at Lambda Legal, and Adri P\u00e9rez, the policy strategist at the A.C.L.U. of Texas, described the officials\u2019 move? What has the response been from groups who support the decision? 7. What do medical professionals and transgender health experts think about treatments for transgender teenagers? What have studies revealed about these treatments? 8. The article includes a quotation from Willow Egerton, 13, a trans girl in Texas who said, \u201cIt\u2019s superscary seeing all these people be against you and want you gone.\u201d Her father added, \u201cThe alternative of hiding feels like that would be the worst solution. Although it\u2019s nerve-racking and although it\u2019s scary, the last thing we want to do is be silenced.\u201d How do you feel reading those statements? Have you ever felt you have had to silence a part of yourself or your identity? How did that feel? What is your reaction to the featured article? What perspectives and points of view do you agree with? What statements or positions do you disagree with? Why? Limiting trans care. Republicans in Texas are seeking to criminalize medical treatments that help align trans teens\u2019 bodies with their gender identities. Here is what to know about the efforts: Failed bills. Texas has repeatedly considered bills that would have banned gender-affirming treatment for teenagers, yet all have so far failed. One proposal sought to redefine child abuse to include gender-affirming treatment for transgender children. An opinion and an order. Attorney General Ken Paxton recently issued an opinion stating that providing treatments like puberty-suppressing drugs to transgender teenagers should be investigated as child abuse. Shortly after, Gov. Abbott reaffirmed the notion in a letter to state health agencies. The political stakes. The moves by Mr. Abbott and Mr. Paxton, both two-term Republican incumbents, came days before Texas\u2019s primary election on March 1, in which each faced challenges from far-right opponents who have questioned whether they have been sufficiently conservative. Investigations begin. While Gov. Abbott\u2019s order doesn\u2019t change Texas law, the state\u2019s child welfare agency has begun investigating child abuse claims related to trans care. On March 1, the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and Lambda Legal went to state court in Austin to try to stop one such inquiry. The pushback. Professional medical groups and transgender health experts have condemned attempts to limit trans care. Some county and district attorneys in Texas have said they would not prosecute families of transgender children for child abuse under the new definition. Revisit your journal entries from the warm-up. Have your opinions changed since reading article? Have you learned anything new to add to what you wrote?\n\nBefore engaging in a class discussion, take a moment to review your classroom contract or ground rules. If you don\u2019t have one, here is a guide for contracting from Facing History and Ourselves. Next, you will use a Big Paper silent discussion model to begin this conversation. Each pair or small group will receive a large piece of paper with text in the middle. Each group will have a different text \u2014 a quote from the featured article \u2014 to respond to. Here are four possibilities, though there are many passages in the article that could be substituted: 1. Texas officials have begun investigating parents of transgender adolescents for possible child abuse, according to a lawsuit filed on Tuesday, after Gov. Greg Abbott directed them last week to handle certain medical treatments as possible crimes. 2. \u201cWe are terrified for Mary\u2019s health and well-being, and for our family,\u201d wrote the employee in a declaration filed with the suit, in which she and her husband are identified as Jane and John Doe. \u201cI feel betrayed by my state and the agency for whom I work.\u201d She added: \u201cNot providing Mary with the medically necessary health care that she needs is not an option for us.\u201d 3. As Mr. Abbott described in his letter, the order would mean that \u201call licensed professionals who have direct contact with children\u201d would be required to report to state authorities those that they believe are receiving gender-affirming treatment, or face criminal penalties. 4. \u201cMinors are prohibited from purchasing paint, cigarettes, alcohol, or even getting a tattoo,\u201d Jonathan Covey, policy director for the group Texas Values, said in a statement last week. \u201cWe cannot allow minors or their parents to make life-altering decisions on body-mutilating procedures and irreversible hormonal treatments.\u201d In your small group, read the quote, then respond to it in writing. You can write questions or reactions, or you can connect your ideas to what others written, beginning a kind of \u201cconversation\u201d on the page. Just remember: No talking! After 10 or 15 minutes your group will move to another group\u2019s Big Paper. Take some time to read what that group wrote, then respond to their comments and questions. After each group has rotated through each station and returned to their own original Big Paper, take some time to read what others have added. Finally, come back as a class and have a verbal discussion about what you noticed in the Big Paper conversation. Did reading your classmates\u2019 responses change your perspectives in anyway?

Some have called for her to be barred or separated from regular competition, arguing that her body underwent changes during puberty that gave her a lasting, unfair advantage. But others have contended that there\u2019s no justification for excluding transgender athletes like her. The organizations that oversee college swimming have put out conflicting rules on transgender athletes in recent weeks. U.S.A. Swimming earlier this month announced a new requirement that transgender women must suppress their testosterone levels for three years before competing, a rule under which Thomas would have been excluded. But last week, the N.C.A.A., the national body overseeing college sports, said that instituting a new policy in the middle of the season would be unfair \u2014 allowing Thomas to compete at the N.C.A.A. championships in March.\n\nThese thorny questions over the nature of athleticism are not new in women\u2019s sports. They have come up many times over the past century, typically when an athlete deemed too masculine started to win. Sports authorities have leaned on medical tests \u2014 whether anatomical, chromosomal or hormonal \u2014 to determine eligibility in women\u2019s categories, while requiring no analogous tests for men. But in the realm of elite physical performance, where extraordinary biology is the rule, science has never provided neat answers. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s about how we think about who is a woman, right?\u201d said Katrina Karkazis, an anthropologist at Amherst College and co-author of \u201cTestosterone: An Unauthorized Biography.\u201d \u201cAnd, of course, sport has for a very long period not been at the forefront of gender, equality, inclusion,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s no wonder that we\u2019re having this kind of debate.\u201d\n\nIn 1928, the Olympic Games introduced its first women\u2019s category for track and field events. In the early days, there was public speculation that some of the athletes were too masculine, and even that men were posing as women in order to win. \u201cWomen\u2019s sports was controversial and involved women encroaching on a male domain,\u201d Susan Cahn, a historian at the University at Buffalo, said. \u201cSo the womanhood of women athletes was always questioned when they were really good.\u201d By the 1960s, driven by Cold War suspicions over foul play, the International Olympic Committee established a new medical commission to oversee testing for doping, as well as \u201cnude parades,\u201d in which naked female athletes would be inspected by a panel of physicians, Jamie Schultz, a sports historian at Pennsylvania State University, said. The I.O.C. replaced the physical exams with a genetic test for sex chromosomes in the late 1960s, claiming that the cheek swab would provide a \u201csimpler, objective, and more dignified\u201d way to verify gender. In 1967, a Polish track and field gold medalist named Ewa Klobukowska became the first athlete to be disqualified from women\u2019s races because of the chromosome test, after it reportedly found that she had a type of \u201cgenetic mosaicism\u201d in which some cells carry a Y chromosome. Dr. Ren\u00e9e Richards competed in her first professional women\u2019s tournament in South Orange, N.J., in 1976. Genetic testing faced a major legal challenge in 1977, after Dr. Ren\u00e9e Richards, an ophthalmologist and transgender woman, sued the U.S. Tennis Association for requiring the chromosome test to compete in the women\u2019s category of the U.S. Open. Richards, who had transitioned after playing tennis in the men\u2019s division for years, won the suit.\n\n\u201cIt seems clear that defendants knowingly instituted this test for the sole purpose of preventing plaintiff from participating in the tournament,\u201d a judge on the New York Supreme Court wrote. Richards played in the U.S. Open that year, at age 43. She was quickly eliminated in the singles tournament but made it to the doubles finals. At the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, eight women failed the chromosome test because they carried Y chromosomes. All were allowed to compete after it was shown they had hormonal conditions that had prevented them from going through a typically male development. By the 2000 Olympics, international sports bodies had abandoned the chromosome test and reverted to ad hoc medical examinations. Sex tests based on testosterone began about a decade ago, after the South African track star Caster Semenya won the 800-meter race at the 2009 world track and field championships by more than two seconds. Scrutinized for her strong physique, Semenya was forced to undergo examinations by an endocrinologist and a gynecologist, as well as mental health assessments by a psychologist. The results of those tests were never publicly released, but Semenya later disclosed that she was forced to take medication to reduce her testosterone in order to compete. In 2011, World Athletics, the body overseeing track and field events introduced its first policy for women with high testosterone, limiting concentrations of the hormone to 10 nanomoles per liter. (The average testosterone level in women is below 3 nanomoles per liter, whereas in men it typically ranges from 10 to 35 nanomoles per liter.) Many experts speculate that the rules were changed because of Semenya. \u201cIt was really a reaction to one phenomenal athlete,\u201d said Schultz, the historian at Pennsylvania State. Four years later, the I.O.C. loosened its policy on transgender athletes, which had previously required that they undergo genital surgeries and legally change their gender, to focus solely on testosterone. Transgender women would need to demonstrate reduced blood concentrations of the hormone for at least a year. In 2020, after several challenges in international courts, the World Athletics testosterone rule was upheld. Semenya, who declined to take testosterone-suppressing drugs, was unable to compete in the 2020 Olympics.\n\nTestosterone\u2019s role in physical strength and stamina is robust. Boys and girls are roughly equal in terms of athletic ability until they reach puberty, at which point testosterone surges in boys and their athletic performance typically catapults above girls\u2019. And when athletes take anabolic steroids \u2014 synthetic testosterone \u2014 they can recover more quickly after strenuous exercise and greatly increase their muscle mass. But among elite athletes, men and women sometimes carry similar levels of the hormone. In a 2014 study, funded by the I.O.C. and the World Anti-Doping Agency, researchers analyzed testosterone levels in nearly 700 elite athletes who played 15 different sports. The researchers found that 16.5 percent of men had low testosterone levels and 13.7 percent of women had high testosterone levels, with considerable overlap between the two groups. \u201cThe I.O.C. definition of a woman as one who has a \u2018normal\u2019 testosterone level is untenable,\u201d the study\u2019s authors wrote.\n\nGiven the complex interplay of testosterone, sex and athleticism, some experts oppose all testosterone testing in women\u2019s sports. \u201cT\u2019s effect on athleticism isn\u2019t straightforward,\u201d said Karkazis of Amherst, who consulted for Semenya\u2019s legal defense, using the shorthand for testosterone. \u201cNo study has ever concluded that you can predict the outcome of speed or strength events by knowing competitors\u2019 T levels.\u201d And scant data exists on the performance of transgender women who went through male puberty but later suppressed their testosterone. Joanna Harper, a competitive long distance runner in Britain, noticed that her pace began to slow just a few months after taking testosterone-suppressing drugs during her transition nearly 20 years ago. Toward the end of her first year on hormone therapy, she recalled, she saw a marked decrease in her muscle mass, even though she was still running 100 miles per week. And when she ran in women\u2019s races, she was about 12 percent slower than when she had been competing against men. \u201cThere were plenty of women over the years who said that it was unfair for me to compete,\u201d said Harper, a medical physicist who studies transgender athletic performance at Loughborough University in Britain. In a review of the scientific literature on athletic ability and transgender women, Harper found some studies suggesting that after four months of testosterone suppression, transgender women have comparable levels of hemoglobin, a blood molecule that carries oxygen through the body, to cisgender women. And after one year on hormone therapy, transgender women see significant decreases in muscle mass.\n\nThe creation and funding of separate competitive arenas for men and women has given women a fair shot, allowing them to be seen as powerful athletes, Hogshead-Makar argued. She suggested that Thomas could be allowed to race in a ninth swimming lane but not have her scores recorded in official counts. \u201cIt\u2019s about the principle of having sport continue to be sex-segregated: having a space where women are really honored and where they can triumph,\u201d she said. Harper works with Hogshead-Makar as a member of Champion Women but disagrees with the group\u2019s stance on barring Thomas from competition. Her own transition experience convinced her that testosterone requirements are a necessary, if imperfect, way to preserve fair competition in elite women\u2019s sports. But she said that U.S.A. Swimming\u2019s rule requiring three years of testosterone suppression was excessive and seemed to have targeted Thomas because of her success. \u201cIf we allow trans women to compete, we have to allow them to win, too,\u201d Harper said.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/1936-berlin-olympics-how-dora-the-man-competed-in-the-woman-s-high-jump-a-649104.html", "https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/tests/testosterone", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2500237/", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/09/08/caster-semenya-gender-ruling/", "https://casetext.com/case/richards-v-us-tennis-assn#:~:text=Summary-,In%20Richards%20v.,pass%20a%20sex%2Dchromatin%20test.", "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/08/special-series/olympics-caster-semenya.html", "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1461098042000222270", "https://ivyleague.com/sports/2022/1/20/WSWIM_0120220607.aspx", "https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/17/archives/renee-richards-ruled-eligible-for-us-open-ruling-makes-renee.html", "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cen.12445", "https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/bjsports/55/15/865.full.pdf", "https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(05)67843-9.pdf", "https://olympics.com/en/olympic-games/amsterdam-1928", "https://www.worldathletics.org/news/iaaf-news/iaaf-to-introduce-eligibility-rules-for-femal-1", "https://stillmed.olympics.com/media/Documents/News/2021/11/IOC-Framework-Fairness-Inclusion-Non-discrimination-2021.pdf?_ga=2.207516307.1210589288.1636993769-1638189514.1636993769", "http://www.nature.com/gim/journal/v2/n4/pdf/gim2000258a.pdf", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-athletics-semenya/semenya-accuses-World%20Athletics-of-using-her-as-a-human-guinea-pig-idUSKCN1TJ22P", "https://stillmed.olympic.org/Documents/Commissions_PDFfiles/Medical_commission/2015-11_ioc_consensus_meeting_on_sex_reassignment_and_hyperandrogenism-en.pdf"], "labels": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "women athletes", "weight": 0.09259061}, {"name": "Transgender women", "weight": 0.091810495}, {"name": "transgender woman", "weight": 0.091810495}, {"name": "transgender women", "weight": 0.091810495}, {"name": "testosterone levels", "weight": 0.0875042}, {"name": "women", "weight": 0.08395184}, {"name": "high testosterone levels", "weight": 0.08268083}, {"name": "low testosterone levels", "weight": 0.081921495}, {"name": "cisgender women", "weight": 0.0813884}, {"name": "trans women", "weight": 0.08000043}], "topics": [{"name": "LGBTQ"}, {"name": "Social Issues"}, {"name": "Trans Rights"}], "categories": [{"name": "Science"}], "entities": [{"data": "Lia Thomas", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 9}, {"data": "Katrina Karkazis", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Susan Cahn", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Jamie Schultz", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Ewa Klobukowska", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ren\u00e9e Richards", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Caster Semenya", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Joanna Harper", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "University of Pennsylvania", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "U.S.A.

Swimming guidelines is the requirement that a transgender woman maintain a testosterone level below 5 nanomoles per liter, down from 10 nanomoles per liter, for 36 months before being able to compete in women\u2019s events.

Shelton chugged ahead from the start, plowing through the water and carrying the lead. But as she did, Thomas cruised along beside her, seeming as unhurried as if on a training swim. Thomas\u2019s broad shoulders and long arms, hallmark features of an elite swimmer, mimicked a windmill with the ease in which they pulled her along. Then came the final turn. As Shelton came out of it continuing to fight, on her way to a season-best time, Thomas, with her long, rhythmic, powerful stroke, ate up the margin between them until she had surged past for a near body-length victory. A moment later, the swimmers removed their goggles and acknowledged each other, Thomas reaching over the rope to offer a fist bump to a smiling Shelton. The gesture might have been nothing more than a nod of appreciation between competitors. Or it might have been something more symbolic: a signal of acceptance.\n\nSo much is open to interpretation each time Thomas jumps into the pool. She is a transgender woman, and has excelled this season while competing on the women\u2019s team. She owns the best marks in the nation among college swimmers in the 200 and 500 freestyle, but for some, her success has also set two pillars of the sporting ethos \u2014 inclusion and fair play \u2014 in conflict. Thomas has become a red-meat topic for right-wing media, a divisive matter for L.G.B.T.Q. advocates and a thorny subject for competitors as well as the N.C.A.A. and other sports governing bodies, who are trying to chart a path for athletes who do not fit neatly into the sex classifications used in most sports. The N.C.A.A. last week amended its decade-old policy for transgender athletes. Transgender women \u2014 who are required to be on testosterone-suppressing drugs for 12 months before becoming eligible to compete in women\u2019s divisions \u2014 now must meet testosterone thresholds set by the national governing body of the sport they play. The new thresholds could be in place as soon as next month in advance of the N.C.A.A.\u2019s winter championships, which for women\u2019s swimming is in mid-March. (A transgender man may not compete on a women\u2019s team once he has begun taking testosterone.)\n\nU.S.A. Swimming said on Thursday that it was re-evaluating its policy for transgender athletes at the elite level, meaning the requirements for transgender swimmers could change in the coming weeks. \u201cMany of the policies are in flux,\u201d said Amy Wilson, the N.C.A.A.\u2019s managing director of inclusion. \u201cIt\u2019s a continually evolving space.\u201d Underpinning the murkiness, Wilson added, is a lack of science to lean on, in part because there are so few transgender athletes among the nearly 500,000 N.C.A.A. athletes. (The N.C.A.A. would not say how many had applied for an exemption to take hormones that are otherwise banned substances.) While there have been an increasing number of transgender athletes who have transitioned while in college, the ones who generate the most attention (and criticism) are transgender women who compete in women\u2019s events \u2014 and who win. Those have been exceedingly rare: for example, Juniper Eastwood, who won running events for the University of Montana, and CeCe Telfer of Franklin Pierce University, who won the 2019 Division II national championship in the 400-meter hurdles. And now there is Thomas, who has turned in better times this season than several college swimmers who raced in last summer\u2019s Olympics. Thomas, 22, grew up in Austin, Texas, as an accomplished swimmer. She took to the water about the time she entered kindergarten, eventually finishing sixth in the state high school championships, and followed her older brother to swim at Penn. Thomas gradually emerged as one of the Ivy League\u2019s best swimmers, finishing second in the men\u2019s 500, 1,000 and 1,650 freestyle at the Ivy League championships as a sophomore in 2019. She did this while also distressed, she said last month in a podcast, telling the swimming website Swimswam that she felt trapped in her own body.\n\nThomas came out to her team in the fall of 2019 and swam intermittently for the men\u2019s team as a junior while undergoing hormone therapy. Then the coronavirus pandemic hit, shutting down all Ivy League sports for a year. She dropped out of Penn last year to preserve her final season of eligibility \u2014 the Ivy League at the time did not allow graduate students to compete \u2014 and returned to school in August. It has been \u201cinteresting\u201d and \u201cweird,\u201d she said on the podcast, to adjust to a new time standard during training and in races after having dropped so much muscle mass and strength as a result of suppressing testosterone.\n\nStill, the Ivy League championships lie ahead next month and then the N.C.A.A. championships arrive in March. That will almost assuredly raise the temperature again, as has happened when iconic figures like Michael Phelps, who is making a second career as a mental health advocate, and Martina Navratilova, a champion of L.B.G.T.Q. rights, questioned whether Thomas should compete on a women\u2019s team. Others, meanwhile, will wonder when the discussion will be centered less on the winner than on the human being. And so if there was something enduring about Saturday, it was not the two races that Thomas comfortably won or the two relays where she gamely tried. It was the way she carried herself in the water \u2014 head down, with grace and ease.", "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Transgender women", "weight": 0.08322439}, {"name": "transgender women", "weight": 0.08322439}, {"name": "other sports governing bodies", "weight": 0.07859679}, {"name": "transgender athletes", "weight": 0.07666923}, {"name": "transgender swimmers", "weight": 0.07631769}, {"name": "women", "weight": 0.06787445}, {"name": "most sports", "weight": 0.067427926}, {"name": "other swimmers", "weight": 0.06592145}, {"name": "college swimmers", "weight": 0.064926654}, {"name": "several college swimmers", "weight": 0.06278455}], "topics": [{"name": "LGBTQ"}, {"name": "Social Issues"}, {"name": "Trans Rights"}], "categories": [{"name": "Sports"}], "entities": [{"data": "Lia Thomas", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 15}, {"data": "Samantha Shelton", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Amy Wilson", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Juniper Eastwood", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "CeCe Telfer", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Michael Phelps", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Martina Navratilova", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the University of Pennsylvania", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 8}, {"data": "Harvard", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "N.C.A.A.", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 9}, {"data": "Franklin Pierce University", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ivy League", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Swimswam", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Boston", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Austin", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Texas", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "afternoon", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "A moment later", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Division II", "type": "LAW", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Olympics", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.04514111, "negative": 0.18937632, "neutral": 0.76548254}, "summary": "Thomas has become a red-meat topic for right-wing media, a divisive matter for L.G.B.T.Q. advocates and a thorny subject for competitors as well as the N.C.A.A. and other sports governing bodies, who are trying to chart a path for athletes who do not fit neatly into the sex classifications used in most sports.

She was 86. Tim Brunsden, a friend, confirmed the death. He did not specify a cause but said she had been in failing health. With her statuesque figure, her enrapturing doe eyes and her Zeligesque ability to rub shoulders with everyone worth knowing among the European chic set, Ms. Ashley embodied the swinging hedonism of 1960s Britain as it sloughed off decades of austerity to embrace material wealth. She partied with John Lennon and Mick Jagger. Salvador Dal\u00ed wanted to paint her (nude; she declined). Elvis Presley wooed her. Later, in a series of tell-all memoirs, she disclosed the names of some of her many lovers, including the actor Omar Sharif and the singer Michael Hutchence.\n\nShe was named to the Order of the British Empire in 2012 for her \u201cservice to transgender equality.\u201d In 2015, Liverpool, her hometown, acknowledged her accomplishments by naming her a \u201ccitizen of honor.\u201d \u201cI always say three things,\u201d she told The Liverpool Daily Post in 2008. \u201cBe beautiful, be kind \u2014 to yourself and others \u2014 and most of all be brave. Chins up \u2014 get on with life and be as brave as you can.\u201d April Ashley was born on April 29, 1935, in Liverpool and grew up in public housing. Her father, Frederick Jamieson, was a cook for the Royal Navy who was often away at sea and often inebriated when at home. But she also recalled him as a \u201cgentle drunk\u201d who, after she transitioned, was the only member of her family to accept her. Her mother, Ada (Brown) Jamieson, worked in a bomb factory during World War II. She was abusive, as were the boys at school, who teased April as she began to exhibit female characteristics as she grew up, like rounded hips and breasts, though she still identified as a boy. Ms. Ashley told The Daily Mail in 1970 that as a child she would pray, \u201cPlease God, when I wake up, let me be a girl.\u201d Desperate to prove her masculinity nevertheless, she joined the Merchant Navy in 1951. But once again she was bullied for her physical appearance, and during shore leave in Los Angeles she attempted suicide.\n\nBack in Liverpool, she checked herself into a mental hospital, where she begged the doctors to \u201cmake me more manly,\u201d she wrote in a first-person account for News of the World in 1961. They treated her with drugs and electroshock therapy. \u201cIt lasted a year,\u201d she recalled, \u201cand at the end of the day they told me it was no use.\u201d Unwelcome at home, she moved to London, where she started dressing as a woman. During a vacation in France, she met a group of drag performers, who got her a job dancing at Le Carrousel, a famed Paris nightclub. By then Ms. Ashley was taking estrogen and saving for her transition surgery. In 1960, with a reference letter from Coccinelle, a Carrousel dancer and the first known French person to transition, she traveled to Casablanca, Morocco. There she met Dr. Georges Burou, a gynecologist who had pioneered techniques in gender transition. The surgery lasted seven hours. Ms. Ashley recalled that just before she went under, Dr. Burou said, \u201cAu revoir, Monsieur.\u201d When she woke up, he greeted her with \u201cBonjour, Mademoiselle.\u201d She returned to London, where she registered with the government as a woman under the name April Ashley. Her stunning looks and her background as a dancer eased her way into London\u2019s fashion world, and she was soon modeling lingerie for some of Britain\u2019s top designers. She began acting, too, appearing in a small role in \u201cThe Road to Hong Kong,\u201d the last of the Bob Hope-Bing Crosby \u201cRoad\u201d movies, which was released in 1962. But her budding career was cut short in 1961 when a friend sold Ms. Ashley\u2019s story to a British tabloid. Six months of modeling contracts dried up immediately, and the producers of the film cut her name from the credits.\n\nAfter a two-year courtship \u2014 Mr. Corbett had to finalize his divorce from his first wife \u2014 the two married in 1963. He was fully aware of her identity, but they never consummated the marriage; each blamed the other, and Ms. Ashley ran away with a Spanish nobleman two weeks later. She bounced around Europe for several years, living and occasionally working in Naples, Rome and Paris. She befriended the actor Peter O\u2019Toole and had an affair with Mr. Sharif, Mr. O\u2019Toole\u2019s co-star in \u201cLawrence of Arabia.\u201d When money ran short, she sued her husband for failure to pay her a stipend. He countersued for an annulment. The litigation had all the trappings of celebrity scandal \u2014 Sex! Fashion! The peerage! \u2014 and once again Ms. Ashley made headlines. The case, Corbett v. Corbett, dragged on for three years. In his decision against Ms. Ashley, in 1970, the judge ruled that despite her surgery, she was \u201cat all times a man,\u201d and that marriage between two men was impossible. Ms. Ashley was nothing if not a self-restarter. With a friend she opened a restaurant in London, April and Desmond\u2019s; the food was mediocre, but the crowds were swinging. Ms. Ashley often worked the door, bedecked in Thea Porter caftans and once again running with London\u2019s chic set. Never one to avoid a party, she bragged of once downing 32 martinis in a night. Whether or not that was true, the louche life took its toll, and after a series of heart attacks she decamped in 1975, settling in Hay-on-Wye, a small bohemian town on the Welsh border. In the early 1980s, seeking to start over yet again, she moved to San Diego, where she found anonymity in a studio apartment and a job selling glass swans and alabaster wolves at a wildlife-themed art gallery.\n\nMs. Ashley returned to a very different London than the one she had left. If it was still dangerous to be transgender, life had nonetheless significantly improved in the 25 years since she left. Ms. Ashley was once again a celebrity, this time as an activist. She lectured at Oxford, went on talk shows and was the subject of a yearlong museum exhibition in Liverpool. Still beautiful if no longer young, she adopted yet another identity, that of the upper-crust dowager. She wore her hair in a perfect blue-dyed beehive and was partial to orange accent scarves, impeccable etiquette and incessant name-dropping. She wrote a memoir, \u201cThe First Lady\u201d (2006), with Douglas Thompson. It was optioned for a film, with Catherine Zeta-Jones lined up to play her. But things fell apart when it was revealed that she had plagiarized large sections of the book from a previous autobiography, \u201cApril Ashley\u2019s Odyssey,\u201d which she wrote in 1982 with Duncan Fallowell, and both Mr. Fallowell and the publisher of the earlier book objected. Copies of \u201cThe First Lady\u201d were pulped, the movie plans scratched. It didn\u2019t seem to bother her. Nothing did. \u201cI\u2019m a natural optimist,\u201d she wrote in \u201cApril Ashley\u2019s Odyssey.\u201d \u201cI have a terrific zest for life that frightens even me sometimes. And perhaps suffering is the consequence of this. It doesn\u2019t have to be, but usually it is.

In addition to holding several elected offices, he was a Mr. Fix-It for neighbors and ran the town\u2019s only first-run movie theater.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nMr. Rasmussen, who served two terms as mayor of Silverton, Ore., defied many conventions, gender being just one of them.\n\nStu Rasmussen, who in 2004 became what is believed to be the first openly transgender mayor in America, died on Nov. 17 at his home in Silverton, Ore., where he had served in various elected offices for the better part of 30 years. Mr. Rasmussen, who identified as a woman but typically used masculine pronouns, was 73. His wife, Victoria Sage, said the cause was prostate cancer. Silverton, an agricultural community with about 9,200 residents and a jewel box of a downtown, sits about an hour south of Portland and a half hour east of Salem, the state capital. Despite an influx of people that tripled the population since Mr. Rasmussen was young, it was hardly the sort of place one might expect to find such a pathbreaking politician. But Mr. Rasmussen defied many conventions, gender being just one of them. He belonged to both the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Rifle Association. He was socially progressive but fiscally conservative, and he butted heads with growth-oriented city leaders when he blocked new subdivisions or upgrades to local infrastructure. He was intensely private \u2014 but also, according to Oregon Encyclopedia, \u201ceasily the most recognized person in the community,\u201d a fact established long before he went public with his new gender identity, in 1998.\n\nA lifelong resident of Silverton, he was an engineer and entrepreneur who brought cable TV to the town in the 1970s \u2014 often wiring customers himself \u2014 and remained a reliable Mr. Fix-It for his neighbors, the person they called to repair a janky fuse box or a buggy computer. He also co-owned and operated Silverton\u2019s only first-run movie theater, the Palace. He sold the tickets, served the popcorn, ran the projector and often stood out front dressed as a character from whatever film was showing inside. He entered politics in the mid-1980s, first on the City Council and then for two two-year terms as mayor, both times identifying as a man. He ran unsuccessfully for the State Legislature, twice, before returning to Silverton politics in 2004, this time as a woman. By then, the community had largely come to accept his new identity. \u201cNobody really cared,\u201d Kyle Palmer, the current mayor of Silverton, said in an interview. \u201cEveryone knew him, so that part of him didn\u2019t get a reaction.\u201d He served two terms on the council before running again for mayor in 2008, defeating an eight-term incumbent and drawing international headlines for taking to the hustings in high heels and a low-cut blouse.\n\nThree weeks after the election, members of the Westboro Baptist Church, a religious group in Topeka, Kan., known for staging hate-filled, antigay protests at military funerals and other ceremonies, held a small rally in Silverton, where they lofted signs condemning Mr. Rasmussen and the town. But an even larger number of locals turned out for a counterprotest. Some 200 people, including several men who had dressed in women\u2019s clothing for the occasion, held their own signs, reading \u201cJesus Loves Stu\u201d and \u201cStu Rocks.\u201d The encounter, which also drew national attention, later inspired a musical, \u201cStu for Silverton,\u201d which debuted in Seattle in 2013. Despite his celebrity, Mr. Rasmussen spent his second stint as mayor, from 2009 to 2015, with his head down, focused on the sort of issues that undergird most of life in small-town America. He built a skate park and a senior center. He established an early-warning system at a nearby dam. He ran City Council meetings. He was, in most ways that mattered, no different from any other politician, and the town treated him that way. \u201cA lot of people who are transgender think, \u2018I can\u2019t be myself here. I have to go somewhere else, go to Portland or to San Francisco, and let the other side of me come out,\u2019\u201d he told The Salem Statesman-Journal in 2015. \u201cI transitioned in place. And the community came along with me.\u201d Stewart Alan Rasmussen was born on Sept. 9, 1948. His father, Albert, was a Danish immigrant who at various points in his life panned for gold, delivered mail and managed the Palace Theater. His mother, Nan (Dowling) Rasmussen, was a homemaker. Stu received an associate\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1971 from what is now Chemeketa Community College, in Salem, after which he spent nearly eight years working for a tech company in Beaverton, a western suburb of Portland.

Three years after that sartorial choice, the Malaysian authorities have charged her with \u201cinsulting Islam\u201d and wearing female attire. On Monday, Ms. Nur Sajat, a transgender entrepreneur and social media personality, announced that she had fled to Australia to escape the threat of prison in her home state, Selangor. \u201cWhen I received refuge in Australia, I felt protected to be my true self, to be free,\u201d Ms. Nur Sajat said in an interview with The New York Times. \u201cI felt trapped in my own country, where I was born, because of the laws there that criminalize me and consider me a man.\u201d Ms. Nur Sajat\u2019s dilemma \u2014 having to flee home in order to be herself \u2014 broadly reflects a national division in Malaysia between more conservative Malays and a coalition of liberal Muslims and minority Chinese and Indians who stress the Southeast Asian nation\u2019s multiethnic, multifaith heritage.\n\nMalaysia is bound by a hybrid legal system when it comes to personal or family matters. Muslims, who make up more than half the population, must follow Shariah law. Non-Muslims are bound by civil law. While some of the stricter Shariah laws are rarely enforced, the governing coalition, which draws support from the nation\u2019s Muslim Malay base, is tightening legislation targeting transgender and gay people. \u201cThe government is serious about the issue of L.G.B.T. people in the country, as Malaysia is a country that adheres to the religion of Islam,\u201d Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said last month, shortly after he was sworn in as Malaysia\u2019s new leader. \u201cAny individual who violates the law must face action. Nevertheless, at the same time, they need to be guided and be made aware so that they can return to the right path.\u201d Guiding Ms. Nur Sajat would mean, at the very least, placing her in a rehabilitation camp for transgender people, Islamic officials said. On Tuesday, Idris Ahmad, the minister for religious affairs in the prime minister\u2019s department, offered such a camp as a more palatable option for Ms. Nur Sajat than imprisonment. It is not clear why the charges against Ms. Nur Sajat were made three years after she had presided over the prayer ceremony while wearing female religious clothing. Ms. Nur Sajat, who has a large following on social media, said she had regularly conducted such events and donated part of her earnings to charity, as is the Islamic custom.\n\nIn January, Ms. Nur Sajat received a summons from the religious department of the state of Selangor, where her wellness and lifestyle business is based. It was the kind of missive that strikes fear in transgender people in Malaysia. With several friends and family, Ms. Nur Sajat went to meet the officials at the Islamic department, who said they had received public complaints about her. While inside, Ms. Nur Sajat said that at least three men kicked her and pinned her down. They groped her breasts, she said. The same day, she was handcuffed, arrested and officially charged in a Shariah court. She was placed overnight in a male detention facility. Ms. Nur Sajat\u2019s mother, who witnessed the assault, confronted one officer, asking how pious Muslims could do something like that. He responded that Ms. Nur Sajat was a man so it was OK. (Her account of the assault was corroborated by an activist who spoke to her mother.) \u201cThey think it is justified to touch my private parts and my breasts because they perceive me as a male person,\u201d Ms. Nur Sajat said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t treat me with any compassion or humanity.\u201d After the incident, Ms. Nur Sajat made a police complaint, and a few days later the authorities said that a religious department enforcement officer was called in to give a statement. Since then, no further action has been taken. The religious department refused to comment. Panicked, Ms. Nur Sajat escaped in February to neighboring Thailand, where she was later convicted of illegal entry. That crime could have merited extradition to Malaysia, and the Malaysian authorities made it clear they wanted her back. But Ms. Nur Sajat quietly left Thailand this month and ended up in Australia, where other transgender Malaysians have been resettled through the United Nations refugee process.\n\nThrough the middle of this year, more than 1,700 people were forced to attend a government-run \u201cspiritual camp\u201d meant to counter \u201cunnatural sex,\u201d according to government statistics. Legislation in Malaysia targeting gay and transgender people is rooted not only in religious courts. British colonial-era prohibitions outlaw \u201ccarnal knowledge against the order of nature\u201d for Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Shariah courts have the power to order caning for Muslims engaging in same-sex conduct, but for years the punishment was not meted out. Then, in 2018, two women were subjected to the brutal form of corporal punishment for having sex in the conservative state of Terengganu. A year later, five men were sentenced to caning in Selangor for the same offense, a ruling that was partly overturned by a higher court this year. Ms. Nur Sajat released a video on social media earlier this year questioning whether she should give up her faith. She later deleted the video and said in the interview with The Times that she was in an anxious state because of the assault by religious department officials. Renouncing Islam can be considered a crime in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cIslam is a holy religion,\u201d Ms. Nur Sajat said. \u201cIt is a personal matter, and I have a right to privacy.\u201d Mr. Idris, the religious affairs minister, said last month that should Ms. Nur Sajat \u201cplead guilty\u201d and \u201creturn to a natural self,\u201d there would be \u201cno problem.\u201d He referred to Ms. Nur Sajat by the full name she was given at birth. \u201cWe do not seek to punish, we are more toward educating,\u201d Mr. Idris added. Ms. Nur Sajat runs a skin care, wellness and clothing business, and her appearance on a reality TV show placed her in the firmament of Malaysia\u2019s social influencers. Last year, she went on a pilgrimage to Mecca and documented the trip on Instagram, courting controversy from some Malaysian clerics. One official deemed that she had \u201cmarred Islam\u201d by wearing female prayer attire.\n\n\u201cI myself, when the time comes, will leave because I don\u2019t want to remain in a society like this,\u201d said Shika Corona, a transgender musician. From coronavirus quarantine in Australia, Ms. Nur Sajat said she was forced to abandon a successful business in \u201ca blink of an eye.\u201d She misses home but does not see a way to return as long as laws targeting gay and transgender people continue to be enforced. \u201cI was trapped and cornered in Malaysia because of the Shariah system,\u201d she said. \u201cMy very being, my existence, was being questioned. But I am very firm in my identity as a woman.

She lives just outside Atlanta, with a supportive family and two rescued leopard geckos, Saturn and Juno. Queer Med, a private gender clinic, is a short drive away; two years ago, she started a regimen of gender-affirming hormones there, after five months of asking \u2014 a comparatively short wait. The treatments have precipitated a monumental shift in Piper\u2019s perception of herself. \u201cI\u2019m just more confident in my body,\u201d she said. (Piper\u2019s family members asked that she be identified by only her first name to protect their privacy.) Things are not perfect. Piper still sees a regular pediatrician for her other health needs, but staff members there still occasionally use the wrong pronouns or her former name. Her family\u2019s new insurance plan is not accepted at Queer Med, so they must pay out of pocket for every visit \u2014 about $150 not including lab fees. And the threat of her care becoming unavailable is constant, as Georgia is one of 20 states this year that introduced bills to prohibit or restrict gender-affirming treatments to minors. Piper plans to leave the South after high school, out of concern for her health and safety. But it could all be much worse, she knows. \u201cI am so lucky,\u201d Piper said. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t get the chance.\u201d Many obstacles prevent young transgender people from getting the health care they need, according to a recent study in the journal JAMA Pediatrics; these include stigma and discrimination from the health care system as well as legal, economic and social obstacles to obtaining gender-affirming care. A 2019 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that about 1.8 percent of high school students in the United States identified as transgender.\n\nThe JAMA paper is the first review of qualitative studies on young transgender people\u2019s experiences getting access to health care. It encompassed 91 studies from 17 countries over several decades, and it included transgender and nonbinary youth from 9 to 24 years old \u2014 a broad range, made necessary by the extremely limited data on the subject. \u201cThere\u2019s currently such a huge disconnect between health care providers and trans youth,\u201d said Dr. Lauren Chong, a pediatric trainee at the Sydney Children\u2019s Hospitals Network in Australia and an author of the review. \u201cThe findings were not surprising at all,\u201d said Talen Wright, a graduate student studying transgender people\u2019s mental health at University College London\u2019s division of psychiatry, who was not involved with the research. \u201cIt\u2019s powerful evidence that things need to change.\u201d The major medical associations, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, have endorsed gender-affirming treatment for adolescents. (However, medical guidelines recommend against children under 18 undergoing gender-affirming genital surgery.) But treatment remains contentious for some health care providers, lawmakers and parents precisely because adolescents are involved. Puberty blockers and hormone therapy, the two gender-affirming treatments given to minors, are most effective if taken when puberty begins, around the ages of 8 to 14, before the age of independent medical consent in most states.\n\nNo single set of rules dictates when and how transgender adolescents may receive gender-affirming care. But clinicians generally conduct a series of mental health evaluations in accordance with care practices, such as those set by the World Professional Organization for Transgender Healthcare or the Endocrine Society. These evaluations are meant to assess an adolescent\u2019s understanding of themselves and confirm that medical intervention makes sense. \u201cIt\u2019s to ensure patients make a fully informed decision that protects their future well-being,\u201d Dr. Chong said. Dr. Michele Hutchison, a pediatric endocrinologist at Arkansas Children\u2019s Hospital who was not involved with the research, added: \u201cWe want to make sure it\u2019s 100 percent justifiable and safe, to the extent you can ever do that in medicine.\u201d For the most part, she said, her young patients are sure of their decision. \u201cBy the time these kids come to me, they\u2019ve known a long time,\u201d she said. But some young patients in the JAMA review criticized what they saw as \u201cgate-keeping\u201d measures in these evaluations that restricted timely access to puberty blockers and hormone therapy at a moment in development when those treatments would be most effective. Some adolescents said they felt the need to prove that they were \u201ctrans enough\u201d to get approval, and others expressed frustration when a parent did not give approval for hormone therapy, thus blocking their access to care.\n\nTransgender patients also face broader barriers to health care, the JAMA review found. Insurance proved a common and thorny issue; some families struggled to get puberty blockers covered, and others had difficulty finding a trans-friendly provider in network. And those without insurance faced high costs. There are also wait-lists, often several months long, to make an appointment. Dr. Cassie Brady, a pediatric endocrinologist at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee who was not involved with the research, said that her clinic often has a wait-list of around 50 people. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to get these children in,\u201d she said. For a young transgender person, merely the prospect of walking into a clinic can be distressing. One 14-year-old in the review said they felt \u201cpetrified\u201d to enter places out of fear that their gender identity would be mocked or dismissed. Another adolescent said that clinicians glossed over their identity, calling it \u201cjust a phase.\u201d Hayden Wolff, who graduated from Tufts University in Massachusetts in 2021, started his medical transition at 18. He recalled a visit to his school\u2019s clinic, where his electronic health records were outdated. \u201cHere I am with a high fever, trying to get care, and I get misgendered in front of everyone else in the room,\u201d Mr. Wolff said.\n\n\u201cYou have to make decisions without much information and data,\u201d Mr. Wolff said. He decided to freeze his eggs. The doctor who saw him in Boston had never treated a transgender patient before and made Mr. Wolff feel like a \u201ctrans specimen,\u201d he said. Nurses at the clinic asked Mr. Wolff invasive questions that were unrelated to the egg-freezing procedure. \u201cLab nurses would ask me if I was going to get my penis after this, which ultimately is none of their business,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a kid, you don\u2019t feel like you have the power to say to someone, \u2018You\u2019re making me uncomfortable.\u2019\u201d Clinicians said that it would not take much to begin to improve the health care experience of young transgender patients. For instance, patients should be allowed to list their own name and gender before seeing a doctor. \u201cThis hit me the closest as a trans person who has received medical care, waiting for them to call my wrong name or waiting for them to address me as \u2018mister,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Baer Karrington, a pediatric resident at Seattle Children\u2019s. In the examination room, Dr. Chong said, doctors and attendants should use gender-neutral terminology and avoid terms like \u201covaries\u201d and \u201cuterus.\u201d \u201cYou can just say reproductive organs,\u201d she said. Dr. Sequeira noted that young transgender people of color, as well as rural youth, are disproportionately underrepresented in pediatric gender clinics. \u201cThe future of this work is to make it accessible to youth that we\u2019re not currently serving,\u201d she added.\n\nTransgender adolescents and clinicians both expressed a desire to see more transgender providers, who may share life experiences with their young patients. Dr. Karrington, who is the first transgender resident in their program, said they could count the number of transgender pediatricians they knew on both hands. In Atlanta, Piper\u2019s doctor at Queer Med is transgender, which she found comforting. \u201cThey know what I\u2019m going through and they can attest to the fact that it gets better,\u201d Piper said. While Piper hopes more transgender people become doctors, she wants to be a zoologist, inspired by her geckos. \u201cIt\u2019s my calling,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve known that for a long time.\u201d", "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "health care providers", "weight": 0.082597055}, {"name": "health care", "weight": 0.08234567}, {"name": "young transgender people", "weight": 0.07914269}, {"name": "young transgender patients", "weight": 0.07707507}, {"name": "pediatric gender clinics", "weight": 0.07542316}, {"name": "medical care", "weight": 0.07183019}, {"name": "transgender adolescents", "weight": 0.070533305}, {"name": "more transgender providers", "weight": 0.06794775}, {"name": "gender", "weight": 0.06636312}, {"name": "transgender pediatricians", "weight": 0.066006}], "topics": [{"name": "LGBTQ"}, {"name": "Social Issues"}, {"name": "Trans Rights"}], "categories": [{"name": "Science"}], "entities": [{"data": "Georgia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Atlanta", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "the United States", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Australia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Tennessee", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Massachusetts", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Boston", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Saturn", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Juno", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Queer Med", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Piper\u2019s", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 8}, {"data": "JAMA Pediatrics", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "the American Medical Association", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Vanderbilt University", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Tufts University", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "South", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Lauren Chong", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Talen Wright", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Michele Hutchison", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Cassie Brady", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Hayden Wolff", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Baer Karrington", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Sequeira", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Piper", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.034173824, "negative": 0.39647233, "neutral": 0.5693539}, "summary": "The JAMA paper is the first review of qualitative studies on young transgender people\u2019s experiences getting access to health care. \u201cThere\u2019s currently such a huge disconnect between health care providers and trans youth,\u201d said Dr. Lauren Chong, a pediatric trainee at the Sydney Children\u2019s Hospitals Network in Australia and an author of the review.

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nA sport that rarely makes headlines was at the center of the Olympics on Monday as the first openly transgender woman competed in the Games.\n\nTOKYO \u2014 A niche sport in the best of times, weight lifting has in recent years often made news for the wrong reasons, including doping scandals and widespread corruption. On Monday, it made news for an entirely different reason: Laurel Hubbard, a weight lifter from New Zealand, became the first openly transgender woman to participate in the Olympics. She failed to complete a lift in the first half of the competition and bowed out of the second half, leaving as quietly as she arrived. In a brief appearance before the news media, Hubbard praised the International Olympic Committee for creating conditions that allowed her to compete in Tokyo. \u201cI think that they have reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of Olympism and demonstrated that sport is something all people around the world can do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s inclusive, it\u2019s accessible and I think that\u2019s just really fabulous.\u201d\n\nHubbard\u2019s widely anticipated debut at the Tokyo Games pushed weight lifting onto center stage at an Olympiad already filled with controversy, historic moments and asterisks. Across the sports world, an often bitter fight has raged about her presence at the Games. Supporters of transgender athletes have hailed it, while some advocates for women\u2019s sports, fair-sport campaigners and some athletes have questioned whether she has an unfair advantage. Amid the fight, Hubbard had said little beyond a statement weeks ago after she was chosen for the New Zealand team. She rarely speaks to the news media, though she said in 2017 that she did not see herself as a flag-bearer for transgender athletes. Against her will and out of sight, she remained a spectacle in Tokyo. At the competition on Monday, there were twice as many requests for seats in the press tribune as there were seats. Credentials to enter the mixed zone, where members of the news media can interview athletes, were distributed 10 hours before Hubbard and her competitors faced off. Pacing the hall before the event, Siosifa Taumoepeau, the secretary general of Tonga\u2019s Olympic committee, who was there to support Kuinini Manumua, the youngest weight lifter in the contest, struggled to hide his unease at Hubbard\u2019s participation. He collected his thoughts before saying that the best solution would be for transgender women not to compete in the women\u2019s category. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have a separate competition for this group?\u201d he said. Fellow weight lifters have largely steered clear of discussing Hubbard\u2019s presence. Even the American Mattie Rogers, one of the weight lifting world\u2019s more outspoken figures, told reporters she preferred not to comment on the subject because whatever she said would have a polarizing effect.\n\nSarah Fischer, an Austrian lifter 23 years younger than Hubbard, however, was willing to speak in support of Hubbard. \u201cI wanted her to make a good lift because she had such a hard background and so many people wanted her to lose,\u201d she said. \u201cActually I wanted her to win a medal \u2014 that would be the best, so everybody would shut up about it.\u201d As the clock ticked down to the start of the competition, anxious officials from New Zealand huddled with members of the weight lifting federation and event organizers to discuss preparations for after the event. Of particular concern was how organizers and Hubbard would handle the crush of reporters there to talk with her. During the introductions, Hubbard did not immediately appear with the nine other lifters as they stepped onstage. At the last moment, she emerged and took her place between Lee Seon-mi of South Korea and Sarah Robles of the United States. When her name was called and she stepped forward, she received light applause and a few jeers, unusual in that setting. Hubbard, who had an outside chance at a medal, came out to lift a half-hour into the competition. Her first lift, at 120 kilograms, or about 265 pounds, came amid the sounds of camera shutters. She briefly held the bar above her head but lost control of it as it fell behind her. She shook her head and left the stage. She missed her second and third lifts, both at 125 kilograms. On the second one, she brought the barbell above her head, but the lift was disqualified because she did not keep her arms completely straight. After her third miss, she pounded her heart, lifted her hands in the air, took a bow and walked offstage. Her night over, she entered a room packed with reporters to deliver an address that lasted about three minutes. Speaking haltingly at first, she thanked her supporters and acknowledged that her participation had \u201cnot been entirely without controversy.\u201d \u201cI know that from a sporting perspective, I haven\u2019t really hit the standards that I have put upon myself and perhaps the standards my country has expected of me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut one of the things for which I am so profoundly grateful is the supporters in New Zealand that have just given me so much love and encouragement, and I think really I wish I could thank them all at this point, but there are just too many to name.\u201d\n\nHubbard took no questions and left. Given the momentousness of the event, she was guaranteed to draw attention regardless of where she finished. Hubbard won junior titles in men\u2019s competitions before she left the sport two decades ago and transitioned. Hubbard, 43, is now competing at an age at which most elite lifters have finished their careers. She is 10 years older than Robles, who was the next oldest lifter in the competition on Monday. The gap in age has led critics to contend Hubbard has an unfair advantage. Hubbard stopped weight lifting in her 20s because, she told an interviewer, \u201cit just became too much to bear\u201d as she struggled to cope with her identity. She resumed competing in 2012, five years after she transitioned. When she won three titles in 2017, her performances triggered a firestorm on social media. Hubbard has won several tournaments in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years, but appeared before a global audience on Monday against competitors that included a world-record holder from China, Li Wenwen, and Robles, an American who won a bronze medal at the Rio Games in 2016. (Li won gold on Monday; Robles won bronze again.) Despite the debate surrounding Hubbard, there was little dispute inside Olympic circles. The I.O.C. has left it up to sports federations to decide whether and how transgender athletes can compete, and Hubbard met all the requirements set by the International Weightlifting Federation. Last week, officials from the I.O.C. said they would soon adopt new guidelines, originally developed in 2015, governing the participation of transgender women in Olympic sports because they consider the current rules outdated. With Hubbard gone from the Olympics, the weight lifting world now must return to fixing deeper problems. After decades of rampant doping, bribery, vote-rigging and corruption at weight lifting\u2019s highest levels, the I.O.C. has threatened to drop the sport from the Games if the I.W.F. does not introduce a host of fixes, including rigorous drug-testing measures and governance changes.", "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "weight lifting", "weight": 0.07949459}, {"name": "Hubbard", "weight": 0.0707598}, {"name": "Laurel Hubbard", "weight": 0.06923608}, {"name": "Fellow weight lifters", "weight": 0.06906549}, {"name": "transgender women", "weight": 0.06902163}, {"name": "Olympic sports", "weight": 0.06609833}, {"name": "transgender athletes", "weight": 0.064723484}, {"name": "sports federations", "weight": 0.06355923}, {"name": "sport", "weight": 0.060869724}, {"name": "Games", "weight": 0.058848623}], "topics": [{"name": "Olympics"}, {"name": "LGBTQ"}, {"name": "Social Issues"}, {"name": "Trans Rights"}], "categories": [{"name": "Sports"}], "entities": [{"data": "Laurel Hubbard", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 22}, {"data": "Siosifa Taumoepeau", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Kuinini Manumua", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Mattie Rogers", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Sarah Fischer", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Lee Seon-mi", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Sarah Robles", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Li Wenwen", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "New Zealand", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "TOKYO", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Tonga", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "South Korea", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the United States", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "China", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Olympics", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Games", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Olympiad", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the International Olympic Committee", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "I.O.C.", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "the International Weightlifting Federation", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "I.W.F.", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "10 hours", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "a half-hour", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "night", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "about three minutes", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "American", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Austrian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Asia", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.028736908, "negative": 0.45058334, "neutral": 0.5206798}, "summary": "A sport that rarely makes headlines was at the center of the Olympics on Monday as the first openly transgender woman competed in the Games.\n\nTOKYO \u2014 A niche sport in the best of times, weight lifting has in recent years often made news for the wrong reasons, including doping scandals and widespread corruption. \u201cIt\u2019s inclusive, it\u2019s accessible and I think that\u2019s just really fabulous.\u201d\n\nHubbard\u2019s widely anticipated debut at the Tokyo Games pushed weight lifting onto center stage at an Olympiad already filled with controversy, historic moments and asterisks.
