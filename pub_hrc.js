Brian Kemp Signs Unnecessary, Harmful Legislation Allowing Discrimination Against Transgender Kids Playing School Sports", "description": "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp Signs Unnecessary, Harmful Legislation Allowing Discrimination Against Transgender Kids Playing School Sports  Human Rights Campaign", "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 Georgia Governor Brian Kemp today signed into law Georgia House Bill 1084, legislation that creates an athletics committee with the authority to ban transgender youth from playing on sports teams aligning with their gender identity. In response, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) civil rights organization \u2014 denounced the move as a crass political maneuver at the expense of the state\u2019s transgender students.\n\nDuring today\u2019s bill signing, Gov. Kemp claimed, \u201cWe put students and parents first by putting woke politics out the classroom and off the ball field.\u201d Among other provisions, HB1084 also bans the teaching of \u201cdivisive concepts\u201d about race in public schools. This flies in the face of recent polling that shows strong opposition to education censorship. According to news reports, the \u201cdivisive concepts\u201d aspect of the legislation can be traced back to the Center for Renewing America, a group led by former Trump administration officials that has pursued similar bills in other states.\n\nA recent survey showed that 65.1% of LGBTQ+ people in Georgia had reported experiencing depression in the prior two weeks \u2014 more than three times the number of non-LGBTQ+ Georgians reporting the same. Politicians are culpable for the harm they cause by subjecting vulnerable youth to continued legislative attacks.\n\nThe Georgia bill\u2019s enactment comes after a Utah bill was vetoed by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox. In his veto statement, Cox wrote, \u201cRarely has so much fear and anger been directed at so few. I don\u2019t understand what they are going through or why they feel the way they do. But I want them to live.\u201d\n\nAnother Republican governor, Eric Holcomb of Indiana, also vetoed a bill discriminating against transgender kids playing sports last month, citing a lack of evidence to justify the bill.\n\nHouse Bill 1084 is the second attempt this year by Georgia lawmakers to discriminate against transgender youth. In February, the Senate passed SB 435, which included an outright ban on transgender students playing on sports teams aligning with their gender identity. That bill was never considered by the Georgia House of Representatives and became defunct when the state\u2019s annual legislative session concluded.\n\nThe latest PRRI data show that support for LGBTQ+ rights is on the rise in Georgia and nationwide: 76% of Georgians support nondiscrimination protections, and 59% of Georgians oppose refusal of service on religious grounds. Approximately eight in ten Americans (79%) favor laws that would protect LGBTQ+ people against discrimination in jobs, public accommodations, and housing. This reflects an 11% increase in the proportion of Americans who support nondiscrimination protections since 2015 (71%).\n\nAnti-transgender discrimination in sports is opposed by prominent advocates for women and girls in sports \u2013 such as the National Women\u2019s Law Center, the Women\u2019s Sports Foundation, Women Leaders in College Sports, and others \u2013 which support trans-inclusive policies and oppose efforts to exclude transgender students from participating in sports. So do prominent female athletes including Billie Jean King, Megan Rapinoe, and Cheryl Reeve.\n\nLGBTQ+ kids have real threats and obstacles to overcome. 86% of LGBTQ+ youth report they have been targets of bullying, harassment, or assault at school. Studies have shown that bullying and harassment of LGBTQ+ youth contribute to high rates of absenteeism, dropout, adverse health consequences, and academic underachievement. Kids want to play sports for the same reasons: to be part of a team, to learn discipline, and above all, to have fun with their friends. Kids shouldn\u2019t be banned from sports because of who they are.\n\nA Campaign of Hate Cascading Across the Country\n\nThis year, statewide officials in Texas have tried to criminalize transition care for minors, and lawmakers in Alabama are on the verge of passing legislation to do so as well. In Florida, the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay or Trans\u201d bill stands to block teachers from talking about LGBTQ+ issues or people, further stigmatizing LGBTQ+ people and isolating LGBTQ+ kids if it becomes law. Iowa recently became the first state in the country that had passed statewide non-discrimination protections that include LGBTQ+ people to reverse course by prohibiting transgender women and girls from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity. And in South Dakota, Gov. Noem proclaimed that it \u201cmakes me sad\u201d to hear about high rates of depression among LGBTQ+ people in her state \u2013 just days after she signed the first anti-trans bill of 2022 into law.\n\nWhile the sponsors of these pieces of legislation make disingenuous claims about what their bills will do, their supporters are revealing their true intentions. Advisers and staffers for Republican governors in Florida, Texas and South Dakota, plus a bill sponsor in Iowa, have made public comments this year laying bare that these bills are more about prejudice against transgender people than any real policy position.\n\nAmong the organizations supporting Senator Lee\u2019s legislation are a litany of anti-LGBTQ+ organizations, including Southern Poverty Law Center designated hate groups such as the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Family Research Council. The work of these groups includes efforts to criminalize LGBTQ+ relationships, opposing settled law like marriage equality, and even opposing the repeal of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell.\u201d\n\nNearly 200 major U.S. corporations have spoken out to oppose anti-transgender legislation being proposed in states across the country. Companies like Amazon, American Airlines, Apple, AT&T, AirBnB, Dell, Dow, Google, IBM, Lyft, Marriott, Microsoft, Nike, and Paypal have objected to these bills. Four of the largest U.S. food companies also condemned \u201cdangerous, discriminatory legislation that serves as an attack on LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly transgender and nonbinary people,\u201d and the Walton Family Foundation issued a statement expressing \u201calarm\u201d at the trend of anti-transgender legislation that recently became law in Arkansas.\n\nThe nation\u2019s leading child health and welfare groups representing more than 7 million youth-serving professionals and more than 1,000 child welfare organizations released an open letter calling for lawmakers in states across the country to oppose dozens of bills that target LGBTQ+ people, and transgender children in particular.\n\nNearly 550 college athletes have stood up to anti-transgender legislation by demanding the NCAA pull championships from states that have enacted anti-trans sports laws.\n\nA poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group revealed that, with respect to transgender youth participation in sports, the public\u2019s strong inclination is on the side of fairness and equality for transgender student-athletes. 73% of voters agree that \u201csports are important in young people\u2019s lives. Young transgender people should be allowed opportunities to participate in a way that is safe and comfortable for them.\u201d\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign is America\u2019s largest civil rights organization working to achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people. HRC envisions a world where LGBTQ+ people are embraced as full members of society at home, at work and in every community.", "medium": "Article", "links":

Of those, at least 130 directly target transgender people and approximately half of those (70+ bills) would ban trans youth from participating in school sports consistent with their gender identity.\n\nThe Justice Department issued a letter this month to all state attorneys general reminding them of federal constitutional and statutory provisions that protect transgender youth against discrimination.\n\nHRC recently announced a collaboration with WarnerMedia to launch a video called \u201cLet Us Play.\u201d The video, which features transgender youth playing sports with their friends, calls on leaders and legislators in states across the country to simply let transgender kids play.\n\n\n\n", "translation": "", "locations": [], "reprint": false, "authorsByline": "", "articleId": "40f691251e564b1290e51129e3a69414", "clusterId": "be3c2a9d66d04b20bc477ae4e62b7de2", "imageUrl": "https://hrc-prod-requests.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/files/images/meta_images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_none/kansas-flag-share1200.jpg", "pubDate": "2022-04-26T17:28:58+00:00", "addDate": "2022-04-26T17:34:59.321860+00:00", "refreshDate": "2022-04-26T17:34:59.321862+00:00", "matchedAuthors": [], "reprintGroupId": "8105dc18b9dc4e5590f98d6c203323c9"}, {"url": "https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/tennessee-house-advances-extensions-to-last-years-prohibition-on-transgender-students-playing-school-sports-consistent-with-gender-identity", "source": {"domain": "hrc.org"}, "country": "us", "language": "en", "title": "Tennessee House Advances Extensions to Last Year's Prohibition on Transgender Students Playing School Sports Consistent with Gender Identity", "description": "Tennessee House Advances Extensions to Last Year's Prohibition on Transgender Students Playing School Sports Consistent with Gender Identity  Human Rights Campaign", "content": "TENNESSEE \u2013 Today, The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) civil rights organization \u2014 condemned passage by the Tennessee State House of Representatives of H.B. 2316 /S.B. 2153. H.B. 2316 /S.B. 2153, which is now a few signatures away from becoming law, would extend last year\u2019s prohibition on transgender students playing school sports consistent with their gender identity to also apply that ban to colleges. This bill doubles down on the discriminatory and harmful law that the state already has in place, and it demonstrates that the state legislature\u2019s disapproval of transgender youth has motivated them to single out transgender youth for discriminatory treatment again and again. The Human Rights Campaign strongly opposes both bills and is calling on Gov. Bill Lee to veto immediately.\n\nTransgender students, like all students, benefit from participating in school athletics, and allowing transgender youth to participate in athletic activities consistent with their gender identity in no way disadvantages their fellow students. In fact, the purposes of school athletics programs are very much supported by including transgender athletes. Further, attempting to separate transgender youth from their peers is impractical, unfair, and unnecessary \u2013 not to mention contrary to the requirements of federal civil rights law and the United States Constitution. This bill is a continuation of that attack and is similarly unnecessary and motivated by dislike and misunderstanding of transgender youth. This bill is nothing more than an attempt to publicly ostracize, demonize, and harm transgender children who only want to play.\n\nHuman Rights Campaign State Legislative Director and Senior Counsel Cathryn Oakley released the following statement in reaction to today\u2019s votes:\n\nAlready, Republican governors Gov. Spencer Cox of Utah and Gov. Eric Holcomb of Indiana both vetoed similar bills in their states this legislative session, rejecting discriminatory anti-transgender sports bans approved by their state legislatures.\n\nIn the last three years, anti-LGBTQ groups and politicians have singled out transgender kids to deny them access to gender-affirming medical treatment, prevent them from participating in sports teams consistent with their gender identity, and deny access to bathrooms. 2020 set a record number for anti-transgender bills filed with 79 bills, largely focused on attacking transgender youth; 2021 surpassed that record with 147 such bills filed in 34 states. 2022 is on track to surpass that record yet again. For transgender youth \u2013 who are simply trying to navigate their adolescence \u2013 to bear the weight of these attacks year after year, this legislation takes a toll. Politicians are culpable for the harms they inflict by continuing to consider bills that target transgender youth.\n\n\n\nAlready, more than 200 major U.S. corporations have joined together to oppose anti-transgender legislation being proposed in states across the country, including companies like Amazon, Apple, AT&T, AirBnB, Dow, Google, IBM, Lyft, Marriott, Microsoft, Nike, and PayPal. Four of the largest U.S. food companies also condemned \u201cdangerous, discriminatory legislation that serves as an attack on LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly transgender and non-binary people,\u201d and the Walton Family Foundation issued a statement expressing \u201calarm\u201d at the trend of anti-transgender legislation that recently became law in Arkansas.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign is America\u2019s largest civil rights organization working to achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people.

Trans kids, like all kids across the country, have said themselves that they play sports for the same reasons all kids do: to be part of a team, to learn discipline, and above all, to have fun with their friends.\n\nThis unfair separation not only deprives LGBTQ+ kids from participating in athletics, it further isolates them from their fellow students.\n\nLegislation such as SB 44 has serious consequences on the health of transgender kids. A recent study by the Trevor Project found that 42% of LGBTQ+ youth seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year, including more than half of transgender and nonbinary youth. 94% of LGBTQ+ youth also reported that recent politics negatively impacted their mental health.\n\nHuman Rights Campaign State Legislative Director and Senior Counsel Cathryn Oakley released the following statement:\n\nA record number of anti-transgender bills were filed in 2021, largely focused on denying transgender youth the ability to receive gender-affirming care and participate in school athletics programs. Even more anti-transgender legislation is on track to be filed in 2022. There are more than 320 anti-LGBTQ+ bills under consideration in state legislatures across the country. Of those, at least 140 directly target transgender people and approximately half of those (75+ bills) would ban trans youth from participating in school sports consistent with their gender identity.\n\nThe Justice Department issued a letter on April 1 to all state attorneys general reminding them of federal constitutional and statutory provisions that protect transgender youth against discrimination.\n\nNationwide, approximately 79% of Americans favor laws that would protect LGBTQ+ people against discrimination in jobs, public accommodations, and housing.\n\nLegislators in a record 34 states introduced 147 anti-transgender bills in 2021, focusing on discriminatory anti-equality measures to drive a wedge between their constituents and score short-term political points. In 2021, legislators in twelve states enacted anti-LGBTQ+ bills despite failing to provide examples of what exactly they were legislating against.\n\nMerely introducing anti-transgender bills and peddling anti-transgender rhetoric has already had a damaging impact, leading to LGBTQ+ youth resources being surreptitiously removed from a government website, 11-year old kids literally having trouble sleeping, and a school district banning graphic novels with a transgender character after a parent's complaint. 2021 and 2020 were the deadliest and second deadliest years on record for trans & gender non-conforming people respectively, with the Human Rights Campaign tracking at least 50 violent deaths in 2021 alone. A new Trevor Project survey shows that a startling 85% of transgender or gender non-binary youth say their mental health has been negatively affected by these legislative attacks.\n\nAnti-transgender content on social media is also a radicalizing issue all by itself. This is in large part because transgender young people are among the most marginalized, voiceless, and defenseless communities in America, and because right-wing arguments play on long-standing misogynistic, racist, and sexist tropes about gender roles.\n\nThese bills are the result of a concerted effort by right-wing organizations that have been battling against LGBTQ+ progress for years. Across recent elections, one of the key anti-equality groups working to turn back decades of LGBTQ+ progress has been the American Principles Project (APP). APP and its chief underwriter Sam Fieler have invested millions of dollars in support of anti-LGBTQ+ candidates. In 2020, APP spent more than $2.6 million in ad spending in support of anti-equality candidates. In Virginia in 2021, APP spent at least $300,000 on digital advertising in support of Glenn Youngkin\u2019s gubernatorial campaign.\n\nRestoration PAC, run and funded by major anti-LGBTQ+ bankroller Dick Uihlein, spent at least $1.9 million in advertising across Virginia in support of Youngkin and donated $942,000 to the political arm of anti-abortion group Women Speak Out Virginia. Anti-equality group Free to Learn Action launched a $1 million ad campaign spreading widely debunked anti-transgender misinformation in support of Youngkin\u2019s campaign.\n\nMore than 200 major U.S. corporations have stood up and spoken out to oppose anti-transgender legislation being proposed in states across the country. Companies like Amazon, American Airlines, Apple, AT&T, AirBnB, Dell, Dow, Google, IBM, Lyft, Marriott, Microsoft, Nike, and Paypal have objected to these bills. Four of the largest U.S. food companies also condemned \u201cdangerous, discriminatory legislation that serves as an attack on LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly transgender and nonbinary people,\u201d and the Walton Family Foundation issued a statement expressing \u201calarm\u201d at the trend of anti-transgender legislation that recently became law in Arkansas. And more than 60 major companies joined HRC to urge Texas Governor Abbott & elected officials across the country to abandon anti-transgender efforts.\n\nMany are rightly protective of the legacy of women\u2019s sports in this country, and a robust Title IX is central to that legacy. Importantly, advocates for women and girls in sports \u2013 such as the National Women\u2019s Law Center, the Women\u2019s Sports Foundation, Women Leaders in College Sports, and others \u2013 support trans-inclusive policies and oppose efforts to exclude transgender students from participating in sports. So do prominent female athletes including Billie Jean King, Megan Rapinoe, and Cheryl Reeve. That\u2019s because while there are real issues facing women\u2019s sports, including a lack of resources devoted to supporting them, transgender participation in athletics is not one of them.\n\nThe nation\u2019s leading child health and welfare groups representing more than 7 million youth-serving professionals and more than 1,000 child welfare organizations released an open letter calling for lawmakers in states across the country to oppose dozens of bills that target LGBTQ+ people, and transgender children in particular.\n\nNearly 550 college athletes have stood up to anti-transgender legislation by demanding the NCAA pull championships from states that have enacted anti-trans sports laws.\n\nTrans Equality Is Popular Across All Demographics\n\nThe reality is that however sensational and polarizing this issue may seem, public opinion polling across the country showed strong support for trans-inclusive and pro-equality policies:\n\nRecent PRRI data shows a large majority of Americans (82%) favor laws that protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination in jobs, public accommodations, and housing, and majorities of Republicans (67%), independents (85%), and Democrats (92%) favor nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ+ Americans.\n\nA PBS/NPR/Marist poll states that 67% of Americans, including 66% of Republicans, oppose the anti-transgender sports ban legislation proliferating across 30 states.\n\nIn a 10-swing-state poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group in 2020 showed:\n\u2022 None At least 60% of Trump voters across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should be able to live freely and openly.\n\u2022 None At least 87% of respondents across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should have equal access to medical care, with many states breaking 90% support\n\u2022 None When respondents were asked about how they prioritized the importance of banning transgender people from participating in sports as compared to other policy issues, the issue came in dead last, with between 1% and 3% prioritizing the issue.\n\nAnother poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group revealed that, with respect to transgender youth participation in sports, the public\u2019s strong inclination is on the side of fairness and equality for transgender student athletes. 73% of voters agree that \u201csports are important in young people\u2019s lives. Young transgender people should be allowed opportunities to participate in a way that is safe and comfortable for them.\u201d\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign is America\u2019s largest civil rights organization working to achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people.

Kelly for Vetoing Bill to Prevent Transgender Students from Playing School Sports", "description": "Human Rights Campaign Commends Kansas Gov. Kelly for Vetoing Bill to Prevent Transgender Students from Playing School Sports  Human Rights Campaign", "content": "\u201cBoth Republican and Democratic Governors have joined me in vetoing similar divisive bills for the same reasons: it\u2019s harmful to students and their families and it\u2019s bad for business,\" Kelly said in a release from her office.\n\nIn 2021, Gov. Kelly vetoed Senate Bill 55, an anti-trans sports bill, after legislators passed it last year. Republican governors Gov. Spencer Cox of Utah and Gov. Eric Holcomb of Indiana both vetoed similar bills in their states this legislative session, rejecting discriminatory anti-transgender sports bans approved by their state legislatures. These types of bills and the incendiary, hurtful language surrounding them have a detrimental impact on Kansas\u2019s vulnerable LGBTQ+ population that is already three times as likely to experience depression and nearly twice as likely to experience anxiety as non-LGBTQ+ Kansans.\n\nHuman Rights Campaign State Legislative Director and Senior Counsel Cathryn Oakley released the following statement:\n\nThe latest PRRI data show that support for LGBTQ+ rights is on the rise in Kansas and nationwide: 77% of Kansans support nondiscrimination protections, and 57% of Kansans oppose refusal of service on religious grounds. Approximately eight in ten Americans (79%) favor laws that would protect LGBTQ+ people against discrimination in jobs, public accommodations, and housing. This reflects an 11% increase in the proportion of Americans who support nondiscrimination protections since 2015 (71%).\n\nA record number of anti-transgender bills were filed in 2021, largely focused on denying transgender youth the ability to receive gender-affirming care and participate in school athletics programs. Even more anti-transgender legislation is on track to be filed in 2022. There are more than 320 anti-LGBTQ+ bills under consideration in state legislatures across the country. Of those, at least 130 directly target transgender people and approximately half of those (70+ bills) would ban trans youth from participating in school sports consistent with their gender identity.\n\nThe Justice Department issued a letter this month to all state attorneys general reminding them of federal constitutional and statutory provisions that protect transgender youth against discrimination.\n\nHRC recently announced a collaboration with WarnerMedia to launch a video called \u201cLet Us Play.\u201d The video, which features transgender youth playing sports with their friends, calls on leaders and legislators in states across the country to simply let transgender kids play.\n\n\n\nLegislators in a record 34 states introduced 147 anti-transgender bills in 2021, focusing on discriminatory anti-equality measures to drive a wedge between their constituents and score short-term political points. In 2021, legislators in twelve states enacted anti-LGBTQ+ bills despite failing to provide examples of what exactly they were legislating against.\n\nMerely introducing anti-transgender bills and peddling anti-transgender rhetoric has already had a damaging impact, leading to LGBTQ+ youth resources being surreptitiously removed from a government website, 11-year old kids literally having trouble sleeping, and a school district banning graphic novels with a transgender character after a parent's complaint. 2021 and 2020 were the deadliest and second deadliest years on record for trans & gender non-conforming people respectively, with the Human Rights Campaign tracking at least 50 violent deaths in 2021 alone. A new Trevor Project survey shows that a startling 85% of transgender or gender non-binary youth say their mental health has been negatively affected by these legislative attacks.\n\nAnti-transgender content on social media is also a radicalizing issue all by itself. This is in large part because transgender young people are among the most marginalized, voiceless, and defenseless communities in America, and because right-wing arguments play on long-standing misogynistic, racist, and sexist tropes about gender roles.\n\nThese bills are the result of a concerted effort by right-wing organizations that have been battling against LGBTQ+ progress for years. Across recent elections, one of the key anti-equality groups working to turn back decades of LGBTQ+ progress has been the American Principles Project (APP). APP and its chief underwriter Sam Fieler have invested millions of dollars in support of anti-LGBTQ+ candidates. In 2020, APP spent more than $2.6 million in ad spending in support of anti-equality candidates. In Virginia in 2021, APP spent at least $300,000 on digital advertising in support of Glenn Youngkin\u2019s gubernatorial campaign.\n\nRestoration PAC, run and funded by major anti-LGBTQ+ bankroller Dick Uihlein, spent at least $1.9 million in advertising across Virginia in support of Youngkin and donated $942,000 to the political arm of anti-abortion group Women Speak Out Virginia. Anti-equality group Free to Learn Action launched a $1 million ad campaign spreading widely debunked anti-transgender misinformation in support of Youngkin\u2019s campaign.\n\nAlmost 200 major U.S. corporations have stood up and spoken out to oppose anti-transgender legislation being proposed in states across the country. Companies like Amazon, American Airlines, Apple, AT&T, AirBnB, Dell, Dow, Google, IBM, Lyft, Marriott, Microsoft, Nike, and Paypal have objected to these bills.

"Get the Facts about Transgender People & HIV Testing", "description": "Get the Facts about Transgender People & HIV Testing  Human Rights Campaign", "content": "What is HIV? What is AIDS?\n\u2022 None HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks your body\u2019s immune system, which is crucial to fighting off infections and diseases. Specifically, HIV invades important cells in your body, uses those cells to make more copies of itself, and then destroys them.\n\u2022 None If left untreated, HIV may lead to an AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) diagnosis. People who receive an AIDS diagnosis generally have badly damaged immune systems, which puts them at greater risk for more serious medical conditions. Fortunately, there are now more ways than ever to prevent and treat HIV.\n\nHow do people get HIV?\n\u2022 None HIV is transmitted through the following bodily fluids: blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, vaginal fluid, rectal fluid, and breast milk.\n\u2022 None Most commonly, HIV is transmitted through condomless anal or vaginal sex or through injection drug use. You cannot get HIV from kissing, hugging or other types of non-sexual physical contact.\n\nWhere can I get tested for HIV?\n\u2022 None There are several different ways to test for HIV, from oral swabs to home testing kits.\n\u2022 None There are also thousands of locations across the country where you can get an HIV test at little or no cost to you. Click here to find a testing site near you.\n\nHow often should I get tested?\n\u2022 None The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 get tested for HIV at least once as part of their routine health care.\n\u2022 None Some people, including those that are at a higher risk for receiving an HIV diagnosis, including gay and bisexual men that have sex with other men, transgender women and those who use injectable drugs, should consider getting tested more often, as HIV is especially prevalent in these communities.\n\u2022 None People who are pregnant should get tested in their first trimester.\n\nTransgender People and HIV: What We Know\n\nDespite several years of research on HIV/AIDS and the populations it affects, we know very little about transgender people and HIV. In the vast majority of studies, transgender people have only been counted as their sex assigned at birth, which not only discounts their identities, but leaves them relatively invisible to public health officials and advocacy organizations working toward prevention, treatment, and HIV-related health care.\n\nHRC\u2019s Guide to Getting It Right: Reporting about HIV\n\nTip 1: Avoid conflating HIV and AIDS. These two are related but should not be used interchangeably.\n\nTip 2: Recognize that while HIV may be more prevalent among LGBTQ people - specifically young, gay and bisexual men and transgender women - anyone can contract or transmit HIV. Be careful of implying otherwise.\n\nTip 3: Understand the importance of and difference between PrEP and PEP. Avoid perpetuating false narratives about either strategy.\n\nTip 4: Broaden coverage to include structural factors that often increase the spread and stigma of HIV, such as poverty, racism, and HIV criminalization.\n\nTip 5: Include the voices of people living with HIV in your reporting, but remember people living with HIV are more than their diagnosis.\n\nTip 6: Avoid using terms that are not only outdated and inaccurate but may also stigmatize people living with and affected by HIV.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://mybodymyhealth.org/", "https://www.hrc.org/resources/frequently-asked-questions-about-hiv", "https://mybodymyhealth.org/body-health", "http://www.thebody.com/content/77083/hiv-activists-organizations-call-for-less-stigmati.html?ic=wnhp", "http://hivtest.cdc.gov/", "https://www.hrc.org/resources/hrc-guide-to-getting-it-right-reporting-about-hiv", "http://aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/", "https://www.hrc.org/resources/transgender-people-and-hiv-what-we-know", "https://www.cdc.gov/socialdeterminants/index.htm"], "labels": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "HIV", "weight": 0.12770507}, {"name": "HIV criminalization", "weight": 0.124861374}, {"name": "transgender people", "weight": 0.08862402}, {"name": "HIV-related health care", "weight": 0.08051792}, {"name": "pre-seminal fluid", "weight": 0.0752827}, {"name": "vaginal fluid", "weight": 0.07346572}, {"name": "transgender women", "weight": 0.0720159}, {"name": "an HIV diagnosis", "weight": 0.071804926}, {"name": "LGBTQ people", "weight": 0.07126128}, {"name": "Transgender People", "weight": 0.07089953}], "topics": [{"name": "LGBTQ"}, {"name": "Social Issues"}, {"name": "Trans Rights"}], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "CDC", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "HRC", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.030303905, "negative": 0.13672279, "neutral": 0.8329733}, "summary": "\n\u2022 None HIV is transmitted through the following bodily fluids: blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, vaginal fluid, rectal fluid, and breast milk. \n\u2022 None Some people, including those that are at a higher risk for receiving an HIV diagnosis, including gay and bisexual men that have sex with other men, transgender women and those who use injectable drugs, should consider getting tested more often, as HIV is especially prevalent in these communities.\n\u2022 None People who are pregnant should get tested in their first trimester.\n\nTransgender People and HIV: What We Know\n\nDespite several years of research on HIV/AIDS and the populations it affects, we know very little about transgender people and HIV. \n\nTip 2: Recognize that while HIV may be more prevalent among LGBTQ people - specifically young, gay and bisexual men and transgender women - anyone can contract or transmit HIV. \n\nTip 4: Broaden coverage to include structural factors that often increase the spread and stigma of HIV, such as poverty, racism, and HIV criminalization.\n\nTip 5: Include the voices of people living with HIV in your reporting, but remember people living with HIV are more than their diagnosis.\n\nTip 6: Avoid using terms that are not only outdated and inaccurate but may also stigmatize people living with and affected by HIV.", "translation": "", "locations": [], "reprint": false, "authorsByline": "", "articleId": "b392a8cad18d40e2830a9c0958ff75e7", "clusterId": "26daed3b00114c6d924eb14c81be7199", "imageUrl": "https://hrc-prod-requests.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/files/images/meta_images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_none/HIV_test_1200x630.jpg", "pubDate": "2022-04-18T14:42:47+00:00", "addDate": "2022-04-18T14:50:40.703839+00:00", "refreshDate": "2022-04-18T14:50:40.703840+00:00", "matchedAuthors": [], "reprintGroupId": "5729aa1e0b5848c2ac8cc10da35a702e"}, {"url": "https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/breaking-tennessee-senate-passes-two-extensions-to-last-years-prohibition-on-transgender-students-playing-school-sports-consistent-with-gender-identity", "source": {"domain": "hrc.org"}, "country": "us", "language": "en", "title": "BREAKING: Tennessee Senate Passes Two Extensions to Last Year's Prohibition on Transgender Students Playing School Sports Consistent with Gender Identity", "description": "BREAKING: Tennessee Senate Passes Two Extensions to Last Year's Prohibition on Transgender Students Playing School Sports Consistent with Gender Identity  Human Rights Campaign", "content": "Transgender students, like all students, benefit from participating in school athletics, and allowing transgender youth to participate in athletic activities consistent with their gender identity in no way disadvantages their fellow students. In fact, the purposes of school athletics programs are very much supported by including transgender athletes. Further, attempting to separate transgender youth from their peers is impractical, unfair, and unnecessary \u2013 not to mention contrary to the requirements of federal civil rights law and the United States Constitution. This bill is a continuation of that attack and is similarly unnecessary and motivated by dislike and misunderstanding of transgender youth. This bill is nothing more than an attempt to publicly ostracize, demonize, and harm transgender children who only want to play.\n\nHuman Rights Campaign State Legislative Director and Senior Counsel Cathryn Oakley released the following statement in reaction to today\u2019s votes:\n\nAlready, Republican governors Gov. Spencer Cox of Utah and Gov. Eric Holcomb of Indiana both vetoed similar bills in their states this legislative session, rejecting discriminatory anti-transgender sports bans approved by their state legislatures.\n\nAcross this country, a record number of anti-transgender bills were filed in 2021, largely focused on denying transgender youth the ability to receive gender-affirming care and participate in school athletics programs. Even more anti-transgender legislation is on track to be filed in 2022. There are more than 320 anti-LGBTQ+ bills under consideration in state legislatures across the country. Of those, at least 140 directly target transgender people and approximately half of those (75+ bills) would ban trans youth from participating in school sports consistent with their gender identity. The Justice Department issued a letter last week to all state attorneys general reminding them of federal constitutional and statutory provisions that protect transgender youth against discrimination.\n\n\n\nLegislators in a record 34 states introduced 147 anti-transgender bills in 2021, focusing on discriminatory anti-equality measures to drive a wedge between their constituents and score short-term political points. In 2021, legislators in twelve states enacted anti-LGBTQ+ bills despite failing to provide examples of what exactly they were legislating against.\n\nMerely introducing anti-transgender bills and peddling anti-transgender rhetoric has already had a damaging impact, leading to LGBTQ+ youth resources being surreptitiously removed from a government website, 11-year old kids literally having trouble sleeping, and a school district banning graphic novels with a transgender character after a parent's complaint. 2021 and 2020 were the deadliest and second deadliest years on record for trans & gender non-conforming people respectively, with the Human Rights Campaign tracking at least 50 violent deaths in 2021 alone. A new Trevor Project survey shows that a startling 85% of transgender or gender non-binary youth say their mental health has been negatively affected by these legislative attacks.\n\nAnti-transgender content on social media is also a radicalizing issue all by itself. This is in large part because transgender young people are among the most marginalized, voiceless, and defenseless communities in America, and because right-wing arguments play on long-standing mysoginistic, racist, and sexist tropes about gender roles.\n\nThese bills are the result of a concerted effort by right-wing organizations that have been battling against LGBTQ+ progress for years. Across recent elections, one of the key anti-equality groups working to turn back decades of LGBTQ+ progress has been the American Principles Project (APP). APP and its chief underwriter Sam Fieler have invested millions of dollars in support of anti-LGBTQ+ candidates. In 2020, APP spent more than $2.6 million in ad spending in support of anti-equality candidates. In Virginia in 2021, APP spent at least $300,000 on digital advertising in support of Glenn Youngkin\u2019s gubernatorial campaign.\n\nRestoration PAC, run and funded by major anti-LGBTQ+ bankroller Dick Uihlein, spent at least $1.9 million in advertising across Virginia in support of Youngkin and donated $942,000 to the political arm of anti-abortion group Women Speak Out Virginia. Anti-equality group Free to Learn Action launched a $1 million ad campaign spreading widely debunked anti-transgender misinformation in support of Youngkin\u2019s campaign.\n\nAlmost 200 major U.S. corporations have stood up and spoken out to oppose anti-transgender legislation being proposed in states across the country. Companies like Amazon,, Apple, AT&T, AirBnB, Dell, Dow, Google, IBM, Lyft, Marriott, Microsoft, Nike, and Paypal have objected to these bills. Four of the largest U.S. food companies also condemned \u201cdangerous, discriminatory legislation that serves as an attack on LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly transgender and nonbinary people,\u201d and the Walton Family Foundation issued a statement expressing \u201calarm\u201d at the trend of anti-transgender legislation that recently became law in Arkansas. And more than 60 major companies joined HRC to urge Texas Governor Abbott & elected officials across the country to abandon anti-transgender efforts.\n\nMany are rightly protective of the legacy of women\u2019s sports in this country, and a robust Title IX is central to that legacy. Importantly, advocates for women and girls in sports \u2013 such as the National Women\u2019s Law Center, the Women\u2019s Sports Foundation, Women Leaders in College Sports, and others \u2013 support trans-inclusive policies and oppose efforts to exclude transgender students from participating in sports. So do prominent female athletes including Billie Jean King, Megan Rapinoe, and Cheryl Reeve. That\u2019s because while there are real issues facing women\u2019s sports, including a lack of resources devoted to supporting them, transgender participation in athletics is not one of them.\n\nThe nation\u2019s leading child health and welfare groups representing more than 7 million youth-serving professionals and more than 1,000 child welfare organizations released an open letter calling for lawmakers in states across the country to oppose dozens of bills that target LGBTQ+ people, and transgender children in particular.\n\nNearly 550 college athletes have stood up to anti-transgender legislation by demanding the NCAA pull championships from states that have enactedanti-trans sports laws.\n\nTrans Equality Is Popular Across All Demographics\n\nThe reality is that however sensational and polarizing this issue may seem, public opinion polling across the country show strong support for trans-inclusive and pro-equality policies:\n\nRecent PRRI data shows a large majority of Americans (82%) favor laws that protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination in jobs, public accommodations, and housing, and majorities of Republicans (67%), independents (85%), and Democrats (92%) favor nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ+ Americans.\n\nA PBS/NPR/Marist poll states that 67% of Americans, including 66% of Republicans, oppose the anti-transgender sports ban legislation proliferating across 30 states.\n\nIn a 10-swing-state poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group in 2020 showed:\n\u2022 None At least 60% of Trump voters across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should be able to live freely and openly.\n\u2022 None At least 87% of respondents across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should have equal access to medical care, with many states breaking 90% support\n\u2022 None When respondents were asked about how they prioritized the importance of banning transgender people from participating in sports as compared to other policy issues, the issue came in dead last, with between 1% and 3% prioritizing the issue.\n\nAnother poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group revealed that, with respect to transgender youth participation in sports, the public\u2019s strong inclination is on the side of fairness and equality for transgender student athletes. 73% of voters agree that \u201csports are important in young people\u2019s lives. Young transgender people should be allowed opportunities to participate in a way that is safe and comfortable for them.\u201d\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign is America\u2019s largest civil rights organization working to achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people. HRC envisions a world where LGBTQ+ people are embraced as full members of society at home, at work and in every community.", "medium": "Article", "links":

Healthcare for Transgender Children and Adolescents", "description": "After Governor Ivey Signs Anti-Transgender Bill, Alabama Families and Doctors Sue to Stop State's Criminalization of Healthcare for Transgender Children and Adolescents  Human Rights Campaign", "content": "Today civil and LGBTQ legal rights advocates SPLC, GLAD, NCLR, and HRC, joined by co-counsel King & Spalding LLP and Lightfoot, Franklin & White LLC, announced they have filed a legal challenge in federal district court against Alabama SB 184, which prohibits parents from obtaining essential medical care for their transgender children by imposing criminal penalties on them and their children\u2019s doctors for providing that care.\n\nThe bill, which was signed by Governor Kay Ivey Friday, punishes parents for making important decisions about their children\u2019s healthcare and doctors for providing \u2013 or even suggesting \u2013 well-established medically necessary care. The punishment can include up to 10 years in prison.\n\nThe doctors challenging SB 184 in Ladinsky v. Ivey are Dr. Morissa J. Ladinsky and Dr. Hussein D. Abdul-Latif, both providers at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Alabama and members of the medical staff at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital and the teaching staff at UAB School of Medicine. Dr. Ladinsky and Dr. Abdul-Latif have long-term expertise in caring for transgender children of Alabama families. Under SB 184, they both face criminal penalties including up to 10 years in prison if they continue to provide that support to their patients.\n\n\u201cBy signing SB 184 Governor Ivey has told kind, loving, and loyal Alabama families that they cannot stay here without denying their children the basic medical care they need,\u201d said Dr. Morissa Ladinsky. \u201cShe has undermined the health and well-being of Alabama children and put doctors like me in the horrifying position of choosing between ignoring the medical needs of our patients or risking being sent to prison.\u201d\n\nThe Alabama family plaintiffs are proceeding anonymously to protect their children. They include Robert Roe, and his 13-year-old transgender daughter Mary, of Jefferson County; and Jane Doe and her 17-year-old-transgender son John, of Shelby County. These families have deep ties to Alabama. If SB 184 is allowed to go into effect both families will be forced to choose between leaving the state, breaking the law, or facing devastating consequences to their children\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cLike all parents we want nothing more than for our child to be healthy and happy. We have seen our daughter change from being reclusive and anxious to being an engaged, happy child once we got her the support and care she needs,\u201d said plaintiff Robert Roe, father of 13-year-old Mary, of Jefferson County, Alabama. \u201cThis law threatens all of that and takes away our ability to follow the advice of highly qualified medical professionals. I was born and raised in Alabama and came back here with my wife to raise our family. We love this community which has shown us incredible support. But if this law goes into effect we may be forced to leave the state we call home in order to protect our daughter\u2019s life.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernor Ivey has signed an appalling bill authorizing the state of Alabama to reach in and interfere with family relationships,\u201d said Jennifer Levi, GLAD Transgender Rights Project Director. \u201cParents want what\u2019s best for their kids. SB 184 is an extremely dangerous law that undermines the health of Alabama children and the freedom of Alabama parents. It will not hold up to legal scrutiny.\u201d\n\n\u201cA state cannot criminalize parents and doctors for following medical guidelines and providing needed medical treatments,\u201d states NCLR Senior Staff Attorney and Transgender Youth Project Director Asaf Orr. \u201cThis is an unconstitutional bill that will cause enormous stress and harm to families. A federal court immediately stopped enforcement of a similar law in Arkansas last year, and we aim to obtain the same result here.\u201d\n\n\u201cSadly, Governor Ivey has sided with a misguided Alabama legislature, who were determined to rush this legislation forward. SB 184 purposefully disregards the well-being of youth who will be directly \u2013 and negatively \u2013 impacted,\u201d said Scott McCoy, SPLC Interim Deputy Legal Director LGBTQ Rights & Special Litigation. \u201cAllowing this law to diminish and disregard the existence, dignity, and worth of transgender young people in Alabama is not an option.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernor Ivey\u2019s signing SB 184 into law goes directly against the best advice of the medical community and intrudes on the rights of parents and families to make their own medical decisions. In doing so, the state has criminalized critically important care that is often life-saving for transgender youth,\u201d said Sarah Warbelow, Human Rights Campaign Legal Director. \u201cThese care providers and families care about nothing more than doing what\u2019s best for their children, yet their state government has vilified them.\u201d\n\nLegislation banning and criminalizing medically necessary healthcare for transgender youth has been opposed by healthcare professionals, including major American medical associations. A similar bill passed in Arkansas in 2021 was blocked in federal court.

This bill defies the best practices supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other leading medical authorities; strips away parents\u2019 right to make decisions, in consultation with their doctor, about providing their child with best-practice medical care; and, would require school personnel to out transgender youth to their parent(s). In response to this discriminatory move, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) civil rights organization \u2014 condemned the governor\u2019s action that needlessly harms families, transgender youth, and medical care providers.\n\nFollowing Governor Ivey\u2019s action, Human Rights Campaign Alabama State Director Carmarion D. Anderson-Harvey issued the following statement:\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, Governor Ivey has chosen scoring political points with radical, far-right voters over the welfare of transgender youth and their families across the state. The Governor and her fellow anti-equality legislators in the state capital have recklessly passed a bill that goes directly against the best advice of the medical community and intrudes on the rights of parents and families to make their own medical decisions. They have successfully criminalized critically important care that transgender youth need desperately, and the incredible doctors and care providers who help transgender youth each and every day. In doing so they have jeopardized the future of these doctors, families, and transgender youth who are all considering what their livelihoods will be in Alabama. The legislative package passed yesterday and signed today is the most anti-transgender legislative package ever passed, combining elements of infamous laws like HB2 in North Carolina, Florida\u2019s \u201cDon't Say Gay or Trans\u201d law, and even Texas\u2019s cruel executive action from earlier this year. Shame on Governor Ivey for being such a political coward that she puts children in harm\u2019s way just to serve her own career.\u201d\n\n\n\nAcross the country, anti-equality politicians are working to pass bills to discriminate against and disrupt the lives of transgender people. By making it impossible for doctors to provide care for their patients, transgender youth are denied the age-appropriate, best practice, medically necessary, gender-affirming care that a new study just found reduces the risk of moderate or severe depression by 60% and suicidality by 73%. According to data from the Trevor Project, 42% of LGBTQ+ youth nationwide seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year, including more than half of transgender and nonbinary youth. The nation\u2019s leading child health and welfare groups representing more than 7 million youth-serving professionals and more than 1,000 child welfare organizations released an open letter calling for lawmakers in states across the country to oppose dozens of bills that target LGBTQ+ people, and transgender youth in particular.\n\n\n\nLast year, a record 26 anti-LGBTQ+ bills were enacted into law across ten states. In 2022, more than 300 anti-LGBTQ bills are already pending in state legislatures, about half of which specifically target transgender youth and prevent them from being able to fully participate in everyday life. Lawmakers from coast to coast are seeking to ban transgender youth from participating in sports; criminalize medically necessary, life-saving healthcare for transgender youth; ban discussion of LGBTQ youth and families in classrooms, effectively erasing our community; revive \u201cbathroom bills\u201d to prohibit transgender young people from simply using the restroom at school; and even undermine companies\u2019 own internal inclusion and safe workplace programs.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/major-health-education-and-child-welfare-organizations-oppose-anti-lgbtq-state-based-legislation", "https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789423", "https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2021/?section=SuicideMentalHealth"], "labels": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "transgender youth", "weight": 0.13984416}, {"name": "youth", "weight": 0.1071006}, {"name": "transgender people", "weight": 0.10672273}, {"name": "LGBTQ youth", "weight": 0.10655443}, {"name": "LGBTQ+ youth", "weight": 0.104083434}, {"name": "transgender young people", "weight": 0.10103068}, {"name": "medical care providers", "weight": 0.07931784}, {"name": "transgender and nonbinary youth", "weight": 0.07717739}, {"name": "anti-equality legislators", "weight": 0.071505256}, {"name": "anti-equality politicians", "weight": 0.06969426}], "topics": [{"name": "Alabama"}, {"name": "LGBTQ"}, {"name": "Social Issues"}, {"name": "Trans Rights"}], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "Ivey", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Carmarion D.

The video has a 30 second and 60 second versions. Full text of the video can be found below:\n\nThe campaign, which will air on all WarnerMedia-owned platforms, highlights the social, physical and cognitive benefits of playing school sports for all children -- especially those who might be denied because of who they are and how they identify. The video features kids playing soccer and basketball while listing the reasons they play. From making new friends to having fun, the stories of these children send a powerful message about inclusion during a time of craven attacks on transgender youth across the country. Alongside this campaign, HRC is releasing a new chatbot feature to help LGBTQ+ people and allies have conversations with friends, family and acquaintances about supporting trans and non-binary youth and opposing discrimination against trans youth.\n\nThrough their various brands, WarnerMedia has been a long-time supporter of the Human Rights Campaign and an advocate for the LGBTQ+ community overall. WarnerMedia is one of 227 companies that has signed the Business Statement Opposing Anti-LGBTQ State Legislation stating its clear opposition to harmful legislation aimed at restricting the access of LGBTQ people in society. WarnerMedia also signed onto an amicus brief for the Title VII cases heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, including Bostock v. Clayton County, arguing that sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination should be prohibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. WarnerMedia\u2019s parent company AT&T has had a 100 percent score on HRC\u2019s Corporate Equality Index (CEI) since 2005, earning it the distinction of being one of the \u201cBest Places to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s work on transgender equality, visit hrc.org/campaigns/count-me-in.

Although the Bill is titled \u201cSave Women's Sports Act,\u201d the South Carolina House has done everything except create an equal footing for women in sports. If this was about upholding equality for women, why did the House vote down an amendment that would guarantee equal funding of men's and women's sports in South Carolina? That\u2019s in addition to rejecting an amendment that would require women's sports to have the same number of assistant coaches and amenities as men's teams. The hypocrisy is on full display.\n\nHB 4608 artifically and unfairly separates transgender kids from their fellow students, further isolating kids who are already wrestling with the weight of discrimination. A recent study by the Trevor Project found that 42% of LGBTQ+ youth seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year, including more than half of transgender and nonbinary youth. 94% of LGBTQ+ youth also reported that recent politics negatively impacted their mental health.\n\nIt\u2019s clear the South Carolina House did not consider the serious consequences of bills like HB 4608.\n\nAs of March 31, more than 200 major U.S. corporations, including companies like Amazon, American Airlines, Apple, AT&T, AirBnB, Dell, Dow, Google, IBM, Lyft, Marriott, Microsoft, Nike, Paypal, and the Walt Disney Company, have spoken out to oppose anti-transgender legislation being proposed in states across the country, much of which attacks transgender youth.\n\nHuman Rights Campaign State Legislative Director and Senior Counsel Cathryn Oakley released the following statement:\n\nA record number of anti-transgender bills were filed in 2021, largely focused on denying transgender youth the ability to receive gender-affirming care and participate in school athletics programs. Even more anti-transgender legislation is on track to be filed in 2022. There are more than 320 anti-LGBTQ+ bills under consideration in state legislatures across the country. Of those, at least 140 directly target transgender people and approximately half of those (75+ bills) would ban trans youth from participating in school sports consistent with their gender identity.\n\nThe Justice Department issued a letter on April 1 to all state attorneys general reminding them of federal constitutional and statutory provisions that protect transgender youth against discrimination.\n\nThe latest PRRI data shows that 67% of South Carolinians support nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ+ people. Nationwide, approximately 79% of Americans favor laws that would protect LGBTQ+ people against discrimination in jobs, public accommodations, and housing.\n\nLegislators in a record 34 states introduced 147 anti-transgender bills in 2021, focusing on discriminatory anti-equality measures to drive a wedge between their constituents and score short-term political points. In 2021, legislators in twelve states enacted anti-LGBTQ+ bills despite failing to provide examples of what exactly they were legislating against.\n\nMerely introducing anti-transgender bills and peddling anti-transgender rhetoric has already had a damaging impact, leading to LGBTQ+ youth resources being surreptitiously removed from a government website, 11-year old kids literally having trouble sleeping, and a school district banning graphic novels with a transgender character after a parent's complaint. 2021 and 2020 were the deadliest and second deadliest years on record for trans & gender non-conforming people respectively, with the Human Rights Campaign tracking at least 50 violent deaths in 2021 alone. A new Trevor Project survey shows that a startling 85% of transgender or gender non-binary youth say their mental health has been negatively affected by these legislative attacks.\n\nAnti-transgender content on social media is also a radicalizing issue all by itself. This is in large part because transgender young people are among the most marginalized, voiceless, and defenseless communities in America, and because right-wing arguments play on long-standing misogynistic, racist, and sexist tropes about gender roles.\n\nThese bills are the result of a concerted effort by right-wing organizations that have been battling against LGBTQ+ progress for years. Across recent elections, one of the key anti-equality groups working to turn back decades of LGBTQ+ progress has been the American Principles Project (APP). APP and its chief underwriter Sam Fieler have invested millions of dollars in support of anti-LGBTQ+ candidates. In 2020, APP spent more than $2.6 million in ad spending in support of anti-equality candidates. In Virginia in 2021, APP spent at least $300,000 on digital advertising in support of Glenn Youngkin\u2019s gubernatorial campaign.\n\nRestoration PAC, run and funded by major anti-LGBTQ+ bankroller Dick Uihlein, spent at least $1.9 million in advertising across Virginia in support of Youngkin and donated $942,000 to the political arm of anti-abortion group Women Speak Out Virginia. Anti-equality group Free to Learn Action launched a $1 million ad campaign spreading widely debunked anti-transgender misinformation in support of Youngkin\u2019s campaign.\n\nMore than 200 major U.S. corporations have stood up and spoken out to oppose anti-transgender legislation being proposed in states across the country. Companies like Amazon, American Airlines, Apple, AT&T, AirBnB, Dell, Dow, Google, IBM, Lyft, Marriott, Microsoft, Nike, and Paypal have objected to these bills. Four of the largest U.S. food companies also condemned \u201cdangerous, discriminatory legislation that serves as an attack on LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly transgender and nonbinary people,\u201d and the Walton Family Foundation issued a statement expressing \u201calarm\u201d at the trend of anti-transgender legislation that recently became law in Arkansas. And more than 60 major companies joined HRC to urge Texas Governor Abbott & elected officials across the country to abandon anti-transgender efforts.\n\nMany are rightly protective of the legacy of women\u2019s sports in this country, and a robust Title IX is central to that legacy. Importantly, advocates for women and girls in sports \u2013 such as the National Women\u2019s Law Center, the Women\u2019s Sports Foundation, Women Leaders in College Sports, and others \u2013 support trans-inclusive policies and oppose efforts to exclude transgender students from participating in sports. So do prominent female athletes including Billie Jean King, Megan Rapinoe, and Cheryl Reeve. That\u2019s because while there are real issues facing women\u2019s sports, including a lack of resources devoted to supporting them, transgender participation in athletics is not one of them.\n\nThe nation\u2019s leading child health and welfare groups representing more than 7 million youth-serving professionals and more than 1,000 child welfare organizations released an open letter calling for lawmakers in states across the country to oppose dozens of bills that target LGBTQ+ people, and transgender children in particular.\n\nNearly 550 college athletes have stood up to anti-transgender legislation by demanding the NCAA pull championships from states that have enacted anti-trans sports laws.\n\nTrans Equality Is Popular Across All Demographics\n\nThe reality is that however sensational and polarizing this issue may seem, public opinion polling across the country showed strong support for trans-inclusive and pro-equality policies:\n\nRecent PRRI data shows a large majority of Americans (82%) favor laws that protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination in jobs, public accommodations, and housing, and majorities of Republicans (67%), independents (85%), and Democrats (92%) favor nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ+ Americans.\n\nA PBS/NPR/Marist poll states that 67% of Americans, including 66% of Republicans, oppose the anti-transgender sports ban legislation proliferating across 30 states.\n\nIn a 10-swing-state poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group in 2020 showed:\n\u2022 None At least 60% of Trump voters across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should be able to live freely and openly.\n\u2022 None At least 87% of respondents across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should have equal access to medical care, with many states breaking 90% support\n\u2022 None When respondents were asked about how they prioritized the importance of banning transgender people from participating in sports as compared to other policy issues, the issue came in dead last, with between 1% and 3% prioritizing the issue.\n\nAnother poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group revealed that, with respect to transgender youth participation in sports, the public\u2019s strong inclination is on the side of fairness and equality for transgender student athletes. 73% of voters agree that \u201csports are important in young people\u2019s lives. Young transgender people should be allowed opportunities to participate in a way that is safe and comfortable for them.\u201d\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign is America\u2019s largest civil rights organization working to achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people.

And more than 60 major companies joined HRC to urge Texas Governor Abbott & elected officials across the country to abandon anti-transgender efforts. \n\nNearly 550 college athletes have stood up to anti-transgender legislation by demanding the NCAA pull championships from states that have enacted anti-trans sports laws.", "translation": "", "locations": [], "reprint": false, "authorsByline": "", "articleId": "59db788d2b164e98b8e4c5fca30d0f9e", "clusterId": "36b794cb126246a7b9477c771e08ac9b", "imageUrl": "https://hrc-prod-requests.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/files/images/meta_images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_none/south-carolina-flag-share1200.png", "pubDate": "2022-04-06T18:09:19+00:00", "addDate": "2022-04-06T18:13:10.436992+00:00", "refreshDate": "2022-04-06T18:13:10.436994+00:00", "matchedAuthors": [], "reprintGroupId": "48738d2b3dfb4d9ba07faa007950abe9"}, {"url": "https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/in-dead-of-night-georgia-lawmakers-sneak-through-legislation-allowing-discrimination-against-transgender-kids-playing-school-sports", "source": {"domain": "hrc.org"}, "country": "us", "language": "en", "title": "In Dead of Night, Georgia Lawmakers Sneak Through Legislation Allowing Discrimination Against Transgender Kids Playing School Sports", "description": "In Dead of Night, Georgia Lawmakers Sneak Through Legislation Allowing Discrimination Against Transgender Kids Playing School Sports  Human Rights Campaign", "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 Following the passage early this morning of Georgia House Bill 1084, legislation that creates an athletics committee with the authority to ban transgender youth from playing on sports teams aligning with their gender identity, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) civil rights organization \u2014 denounced the move as discriminatory, unnecessary and damaging to the state\u2019s LGBTQ+ students.\n\nThe legislation comes after a Utah bill was vetoed by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox. In his veto statement, Cox wrote, \u201cRarely has so much fear and anger been directed at so few. I don\u2019t understand what they are going through or why they feel the way they do. But I want them to live.\u201d\n\nAnother Republican governor, Eric Holcomb of Indiana, also vetoed a bill discriminating against transgender kids playing sports last month, citing a lack of evidence to justify the bill.\n\nHouse Bill 1084 is the second attempt this year by Georgia Republican lawmakers to discriminate against transgender youth. In February, the Senate passed SB 435, which included an outright ban on transgender students playing on sports teams aligning with their gender identity. That bill was never considered by the Georgia House of Representatives and is now defunct as the state\u2019s annual legislative session concludes.\n\nThe latest PRRI data show that support for LGBTQ+ rights is on the rise in Georgia and nationwide: 76% of Georgians support nondiscrimination protections, and 59% of Georgians oppose refusal of service on religious grounds. Approximately eight in ten Americans (79%) favor laws that would protect LGBTQ+ people against discrimination in jobs, public accommodations, and housing. This reflects an 11% increase in the proportion of Americans who support nondiscrimination protections since 2015 (71%).\n\nAnti-transgender discrimination in sports is opposed by prominent advocates for women and girls in sports \u2013 such as the National Women\u2019s Law Center, the Women\u2019s Sports Foundation, Women Leaders in College Sports, and others \u2013 which support trans-inclusive policies and oppose efforts to exclude transgender students from participating in sports. So do prominent female athletes including Billie Jean King, Megan Rapinoe, and Cheryl Reeve.\n\nLGBTQ+ kids have real threats and obstacles to overcome. 86% of LGBTQ+ youth report they have been targets of bullying, harassment, or assault at school. Studies have shown that bullying and harassment of LGBTQ+ youth contribute to high rates of absenteeism, dropout, adverse health consequences, and academic underachievement. When left unchecked, such bullying has led to dangerous situations for young people. Lawmakers shouldn\u2019t be bullying trans kids.\n\nA Campaign of Hate Cascading Across the Country\n\nThis year, statewide officials in Texas have tried to criminalize transition care for minors, and lawmakers in Alabama are on the verge of passing legislation to do so as well. In Florida, the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay or Trans\u201d bill stands to block teachers from talking about LGBTQ+ issues or people, further stigmatizing LGBTQ+ people and isolating LGBTQ+ kids if it becomes law. Iowa recently became the first state in the country that had passed statewide non-discrimination protections that include LGBTQ+ people to reverse course by prohibiting transgender women and girls from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity. And in South Dakota, Gov. Noem proclaimed that it \u201cmakes me sad\u201d to hear about high rates of depression among LGBTQ+ people in her state \u2013 just days after she signed the first anti-trans bill of 2022 into law.\n\nWhile the sponsors of these pieces of legislation make disingenuous claims about what their bills will do, their supporters are revealing their true intentions. Advisers and staffers for Republican governors in Florida, Texas and South Dakota, plus a bill sponsor in Iowa, have made public comments this year laying bare that these bills are more about prejudice against transgender people than any real policy position.\n\nAmong the organizations supporting Senator Lee\u2019s legislation are a litany of anti-LGBTQ+ organizations, including Southern Poverty Law Center designated hate groups such as the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Family Research Council. The work of these groups includes efforts to criminalize LGBTQ+ relationships, opposing settled law like marriage equality, and even opposing the repeal of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell.\u201d\n\nNearly 200 major U.S. corporations have spoken out to oppose anti-transgender legislation being proposed in states across the country. Companies like Amazon, American Airlines, Apple, AT&T, AirBnB, Dell, Dow, Google, IBM, Lyft, Marriott, Microsoft, Nike, and Paypal have objected to these bills. Four of the largest U.S. food companies also condemned \u201cdangerous, discriminatory legislation that serves as an attack on LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly transgender and nonbinary people,\u201d and the Walton Family Foundation issued a statement expressing \u201calarm\u201d at the trend of anti-transgender legislation that recently became law in Arkansas.\n\nThe nation\u2019s leading child health and welfare groups representing more than 7 million youth-serving professionals and more than 1,000 child welfare organizations released an open letter calling for lawmakers in states across the country to oppose dozens of bills that target LGBTQ+ people, and transgender children in particular.\n\nNearly 550 college athletes have stood up to anti-transgender legislation by demanding the NCAA pull championships from states that have enacted anti-trans sports laws.\n\nA poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group revealed that, with respect to transgender youth participation in sports, the public\u2019s strong inclination is on the side of fairness and equality for transgender student-athletes. 73% of voters agree that \u201csports are important in young people\u2019s lives. Young transgender people should be allowed opportunities to participate in a way that is safe and comfortable for them.\u201d\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign is America\u2019s largest civil rights organization working to achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people. HRC envisions a world where LGBTQ+ people are embraced as full members of society at home, at work and in every community.", "medium": "Article", "links":

DeSantis. The discriminatory and dangerous legislation seeks to silence teachers from talking about LGBTQ+ issues or people, further stigmatizing and isolating LGBTQ+ kids and also undermining existing protections for LGBTQ+ students. The legislation \u2014 which has triggered major backlash from educators and students across Florida and the country \u2014 would prevent teachers from providing a safe, inclusive classroom for all students.\n\nTo put the focus on those most directly impacted by the legislation, event speakers and HRC staff displayed images of Florida students during the virtual press briefing rather than appearing on video. The students \u2014 each with tape or a hand over their mouth \u2014 sought to convey how they feel silenced by Florida\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay or Trans\u201d law.\n\nHEAR WHAT THESE TEACHERS, ADVOCATES, AND PARENTS ARE SAYING ABOUT THE DISCRIMINATORY AND UNPOPULAR BILL PASSED IN FLORIDA:\n\n\u201cEach of our speakers today has agreed to put up a photo submitted by students instead of appearing on camera so that we can call attention to the very real fears that this law has sparked in the classrooms and hallways of Florida schools. Let me be clear \u2014 every student deserves to be seen. Every student deserves an education that prepares them for health and success, and every student deserves leaders who will stand with them, not bully or attack them.\u201d\n\n\u201cKids have one job when they go to school \u2014 that's to learn. Instead, LGBTQ+ kids, the kids who might feel different but they don't know the words yet, will spend their days forced to hide key parts of themselves and their families. \u2026 We're calling on Ron DeSantis and the state of Florida to repeal the dangerous and backward \u2018Don't Say Gay or Trans\u2019 law and let kids learn.\"\n\n\u201cAs long as this policy is in effect, it is a stain on the state of Florida and an ongoing, unwarranted attack on vulnerable people who did nothing to deserve it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a result of this law, students in Florida may now for the first time be made to feel shame and stigma about their families or their own identities, and we should be clear we're already seeing the harmful effects on the ground in Florida, even before Governor DeSantis signed this bill into law.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo all the students across Florida who organized themselves to walk out of class, to hold protests, some of them marched at the Capitol and made legislators walk between them, I just want to say to those leaders, those students, who bear the brunt of this bill \u2014 your leadership is going to make all the difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cI've worked every level of education and they stand upon one core belief, and that core belief is that every public school student \u2014 Black, white, Brown, indigenous, AAPI, LGBTQ+, and differently-abled \u2014 every, every, every student should receive the preparation they need to succeed in a diverse world.\"\n\n\u201cThe law leads educators to determine for themselves what they are able to say \u2014 a wrong guess could result in a lawsuit. Our LGBTQ+ educators are role models for our LGBTQ+ students.\u201d\n\n\u201cRather than putting into place harmful laws that create fear and promote dishonesty, Florida should be focused on creating public schools in a place of safety, hope and promise so that every student, every student, every student, and every educator, every educator, every educator, will feel safe, welcomed, encouraged, and supported.\"\n\n\u201cEvery student deserves to feel safe, to feel protected, and to feel like they belong. Unfortunately, this \u2018Don't Say Gay or Trans\u2019 Bill does quite the opposite.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe current wave of anti-LGBTQ bills across the country isn't an attack on LGBTQ people alone. It's an attack on all of our freedoms and democratic ideals as a nation. We all deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, no matter who we are.\u201d\n\nJennifer Solomon, Florida mom and member of HRC\u2019s Parents for Transgender Equality Council\n\n\u201cRight now, I'm speaking as the parent of an LGBTQ+ child in Florida, and I'm terrified. I feel my family is being targeted and used as a political pawn. We're just a regular family raising a terrific, fabulous child, and he deserves respect and not to be harmed for living as his authentic self.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagine being a preteen and trying to navigate adolescence and now learning that it's illegal to talk about who you are \u2014 that is going to be my child's reality next year as he enters middle school.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy real fear isn't only for Cooper, but for the thousands of kids who don't have a trusted adult to talk to. Teachers are that source for so many, and with this new law, they can be fired or sued for that, and that just breaks my heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey're creating a solution for something that's just not a problem. I see the pain and confusion on Cooper's face when he asks me \u2018Why are the adults that are supposed to be representing us being bullies?\u2019 and I truly can't answer that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur school motto is literally \u2018family, memory, and passion,\u2019 that is what we live by \u2026 and part of doing that is sharing our family and experiences at home, sharing our love for our passions and hobbies \u2026 one of the biggest things I'm struggling with right now is how am I going to respond when my students ask me \u2018Mr. Bernaert, what did you do over the weekend?\u2019 \u2018Mr. Bernaert, who is that boy in the picture next to you?\u2019\n\n\u201cThese conversations are happening whether we want them to or not, and it's okay for them to happen ... this law is so unclear as to what can happen to me if I'm having those discussions with my kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm very, personally affected by the words that are being used with this bill (\u2018injecting\u2019 and \u2018indoctrinating\u2019) because when you start using those words with LGBTQ+ people, it sends a clear message to how they really feel about us as human beings. Just because we love differently, I feel that my love is less \u2026 because they use those words.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs teachers, we do feel this bill \u2014 it's not just something that's on paper. It's not just something that they think is helping to protect parents. It is affecting us in the classroom every day. It's affecting the mental health of educators like myself. It\u2019s affecting parents who are part of the LGBTQ+ community who have children inside the schools.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause this bill is so vague and because it is so overbroad, the chilling effect is an incredibly important aspect of this, because if the bill was meant to be only about curriculum, that's not actually what it says, and it's certainly already not even what the impact is \u2026 this bill is absolutely intended to marginalize LGBTQ+ youth, to take conversations about LGBTQ+ youth out of the classroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Florida, we're seeing the collision of that movement with this movement that relates to critical race theory and banning books...the kids are learning challenging concepts in schools, and by educating children and sharing with them the truth of what the world looks like, that's in some way hurting the fabric of American society instead of, in fact, strengthening it. That movement is colliding in Florida with this movement to really harm trans youth and to use trans youth as political pawns in service of national political ambitions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a victimless crime, this truly will hurt kids\u2026 they are either recklessly hurting these kids or intentionally hurting these kids, and they're doing so in service of political goals that only... is welcomed by a very small section of the American electorate. It's deeply unfortunate and it is truly alarming, frightening, and despicable.\u201d\n\nLGBTQ+ kids have real threats and obstacles to overcome. 86% of LGBTQ+ youth report they have been targets of bullying, harassment, or assault at school. Studies have shown that bullying and harassment of LGBTQ+ youth contribute to high rates of absenteeism, dropout, adverse health consequences, and academic underachievement.\n\nHRC also opposes the \u201cStop WOKE Act\u201d (HB 7), another dangerous bill that is currently awaiting DeSantis\u2019s signature. If enacted, this bill would limit protected speech in workplaces with more than fifteen employees and classrooms by censoring honest dialogue about systemic racism, gender, and race discrimination. It would also change Florida\u2019s employment discrimination statutes to give employees the ability to file discrimination claims against an employer engaging in trainings or discussions about Black history, LGBTQ+ issues, and other concepts of injustice and discrimination.\n\nAccording to the Public Opinion Research Lab (PORL) at the University of North Florida, 49% of Floridians oppose the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay or Trans\u201d bill while only 40% support it. Opposition for the bill is even stronger in younger populations. A majority of Floridians between the ages of 18 and 24 \u2014 recent secondary school graduates \u2014 disapprove of efforts to erase LGBTQ+ people in classrooms.\n\nMeanwhile, Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, and Former Speaker of the Texas House Joe Straus \u2013 all Republicans \u2013 each recently chose to stand on the right side of history by speaking out against the coordinated legislative attacks on the LGBTQ+ community \u2013 especially transgender youth \u2013 underway in their states and nationwide.\n\nNationally, support for nondiscrimination protections is the highest it\u2019s ever been, overall, and across state, religious affiliation, and party membership: According to a recent report from PRRI, approximately eight in ten Americans (79%) favor laws that would protect LGBTQ+ people against discrimination in jobs, public accommodations, and housing. This reflects an 11% increase in the proportion of Americans who support nondiscrimination protections since 2015 (71%).\n\nThe PRRI study also shows that legislation like the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay or Trans\u201d bill is unlikely to gain support from state residents \u2014 80% of Floridians support nondiscrimination protections, and 66% of Floridians oppose refusal of service on religious grounds.\n\nThe nation\u2019s leading child health and welfare groups, representing more than 7 million youth-serving professionals and more than 1,000 child welfare organizations, recently released an open letter calling for lawmakers in states across the country to oppose dozens of bills that target LGBTQ+ people, and transgender children in particular.\n\nNearly 200 major U.S. corporations have stood up and spoken out to oppose anti-LGBTQ+ legislation being proposed in states across the country. Companies like Amazon, American Airlines, Apple, Airbnb, Disney, Dell, Dow, Google, IBM, Marriott, Microsoft, Nike , and Wells Fargo have objected to anti-LGBTQ+ state legislation. Apple CEO Tim Cook has made it clear that he stands with LGBTQ+ youth harmed by legislation like HB 1557. More than 60 businesses went on the record earlier this month with an ad placed in the Dallas Morning News calling on public leaders to abandon efforts to write discimrination into law and policy. Apple, Capital One, Google, IBM, Johnson & Johnson, Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce and Unilever were among the more than 60 businesses that joined the ad. Only weeks ago, Rosanna Durruthy, Vice President, Global Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at LinkedIn, invited the LinkedIn community to stand up for LGBTQ+ families and their right to make decisions to support their loved ones.\n\nThe signing of the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay or Trans\u201d bill arrives at a time when statewide officials in Texas have tried to criminalize transition care for minors, and lawmakers in Alabama are on the verge of passing legislation to do so as well. Iowa recently became the first state in the country that had passed statewide non-discrimination protections that include LGBTQ+ people to reverse course by prohibiting transgender women and girls from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity. And in South Dakota, Gov. Noem proclaimed that it \u201cmakes me sad\u201d to hear about high rates of depression among LGBTQ+ people in her state \u2013 just days after she signed the first anti-trans bill of 2022 into law.\n\nJust three months into the year, HRC is tracking 583+ pieces of potentially LGBTQ+-related legislation introduced in the 2022 state legislative session. Of those, at least 313 are classified as harmful to the LGBTQ+ community, and 137+ are specifically anti-transgender bills.\n\nWhile the sponsors of these pieces of legislation make disingenuous claims about what their bills will do, their own statements and those of their supporters are revealing their true intentions. Governor DeSantis\u2019 own press secretary, as well as advisers and staffers for Republican governors in Texas and South Dakota, and a bill sponsor in Iowa, have made public hateful comments this year laying bare that these bills are more about prejudice against transgender people than any real policy position.\n\nGroups like the Heritage Foundation, Alliance Defending Freedom, Eagle Forum, and others are at the helm of this effort, seeking to use LGBTQ+ rights as a political wedge.\n\nThese bills are the result of a concerted effort by right-wing organizations that have been battling against LGBTQ+ progress for years. Across recent elections, one of the key anti-equality groups working to turn back decades of LGBTQ+ progress has been the American Principles Project (APP). APP and its chief underwriter Sam Fieler have invested millions of dollars in support of anti-LGBTQ+ candidates. In 2020, APP spent more than $2.6 million in ad spending in support of anti-equality candidates. In Virginia in 2021, APP spent at least $300,000 on digital advertising in support of Glenn Youngkin\u2019s gubernatorial campaign.\n\nRestoration PAC, run and funded by major anti-LGBTQ+ bankroller Dick Uihlein, spent at least $1.9 million in advertising across Virginia in support of Youngkin and donated $942,000 to the political arm of anti-abortion group Women Speak Out Virginia. Anti-equality group Free to Learn Action launched a $1 million ad campaign spreading widely debunked anti-transgender misinformation in support of Youngkin\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign is America\u2019s largest civil rights organization working to achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people. HRC envisions a world where LGBTQ people are embraced as full members of society at home, at work and in every community.", "medium": "Article", "links":

Earlier this week, the HRC Foundation, in partnership with Civis Analytics, released Trans Lives & Positive Visibility: How News & Media Can Positively Cover Trans and Non-Binary Stories. This report gives new insight into how media coverage and broader \u201cvisibility\u201d can both affect society\u2019s perception of the transgender community as a whole, as well as transgender individuals. Further, it identifies how media sources may either intentionally, or inadvertently, perpetuate stigma towards trans and non-binary people in the stories that they cover and the way they cover them.\n\nTransgender and non-binary people continue to face legislative and executive attacks across the United States. So far, in 2022, HRC is tracking 583+ pieces of potentially LGBTQ+-related legislation and, of those, atlmore than 310 are anti-LGBTQ+, and more than 135+ are specifically anti-transgender bills. Earlier this week in Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the so-called \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay or Trans\u201d bill (HB 1557) \u2014 discriminatory and dangerous legislation that seeks to silence teachers from talking about LGBTQ+ issues or people\u2014into law. Iowa, South Dakota, and Utah have enacted laws this year that ban transgender girls from participating in sports, and seven other pieces of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation await action by governors in Arizona, Florida, Kentucky, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Additionally, last month, Texas Gov. Abbott and Texas Attorney General Paxton took unprecedented steps to prevent transgender youth from accessing best-practice, age-appropriate, medically necessary, gender-affirming care by threatening to charge parents and medical care providers of transgender children with child abuse.\n\nAs part of our efforts to combat anti-trans actions in Texas specifically, HRC will be joining with coalition partners for a Trans Day of Visibility Rally on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol. Texas has become a flashpoint in recent months, with lawless, groundless attacks on transgender youth and their families by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Atty. Gen. Ken Paxton. HRC previously worked with more than 60 major companies to speak out in opposition to these acts, and shared an open letter signed by thousands of parents of trans youth calling attention to the attacks on transgender people across the country.\n\nWhile TDOV represents a much-needed opportunity to celebrate trans joy and uplift trans lives, we must pause to acknowledge the ongoing epidemic of violence against transgender and non-binary people, especially against Black and Brown transgender women. In November 2021, ahead of Transgender Day of Remembrance, the HRC Foundation released \u201cAn Epidemic of Violence: Fatal Violence Against Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming People in 2021,\u201d a heartbreaking report honoring the trans people killed and detailing the contributing and motivating factors that lead to this tragic violence. Sadly, 2021 was the deadliest year yet on record, seeing at least 57 trans or gender non-conforming people in the U.S. fatally killed by violent means.

Unfortunately, Speaker of the House Bowers sent SB 1138 and SB 1165 to a vote on the House floor knowing that several members of the legislature who oppose this legislation were on their way to a legislator conference.\n\nSB 1138 is a cruel and potentially life-threatening bill that would harm transgender youth for whom gender-affirming services are medically necessary.

Even more anti-transgender legislation is on track to be filed in 2022. There are more than 320 anti-LGBTQ+ bills under consideration in state legislatures across the country.

There are real consequences to the discrimination perpetrated upon LGBTQ+ people, and particularly transgender youth. According to a recent analysis, 55% of LGBTQ+ Arizonans reported they\u2019ve suffered from depression in the past two weeks.\n\nIn a recent roundtable, parents on transgender youth in Arizona spoke out about the harm these bills have on their children\u2019s mental health and well-being. A recording of the roundtable can be found here.\n\nThe latest PRRI data show that support for LGBTQ+ rights is on the rise in Arizona and nationwide: 77% of Arizonans support nondiscrimination protections, and 67% of Arizonans oppose refusal of service on religious grounds. Approximately eight in ten Americans (79%) favor laws that would protect LGBTQ+ people against discrimination in jobs, public accommodations, and housing. This reflects an 11% increase in the proportion of Americans who support nondiscrimination protections since 2015 (71%).\n\nLegislators in a record 34 states introduced 147 anti-transgender bills in 2021, focusing on discriminatory anti-equality measures to drive a wedge between their constituents and score short-term political points. In 2021, legislators in twelve states enacted anti-LGBTQ+ bills despite failing to provide examples of what exactly they were legislating against.\n\nMerely introducing anti-transgender bills and peddling anti-transgender rhetoric has already had a damaging impact, leading to LGBTQ+ youth resources being surreptitiously removed from a government website, 11-year old kids literally having trouble sleeping, and a school district banning graphic novels with a transgender character after a parent's complaint. 2021 and 2020 were the deadliest and second deadliest years on record for trans & gender non-conforming people respectively, with the Human Rights Campaign tracking at least 50 violent deaths in 2021 alone. A new Trevor Project survey shows that a startling 85% of transgender or gender non-binary youth say their mental health has been negatively affected by these legislative attacks.\n\nAnti-transgender content on social media is also a radicalizing issue all by itself. This is in large part because transgender young people are among the most marginalized, voiceless, and defenseless communities in America, and because right-wing arguments play on long-standing misogynistic, racist, and sexist tropes about gender roles.\n\nThese bills are the result of a concerted effort by right-wing organizations that have been battling against LGBTQ+ progress for years. Across recent elections, one of the key anti-equality groups working to turn back decades of LGBTQ+ progress has been the American Principles Project (APP). APP and its chief underwriter Sam Fieler have invested millions of dollars in support of anti-LGBTQ+ candidates. In 2020, APP spent more than $2.6 million in ad spending in support of anti-equality candidates. In Virginia in 2021, APP spent at least $300,000 on digital advertising in support of Glenn Youngkin\u2019s gubernatorial campaign.\n\nRestoration PAC, run and funded by major anti-LGBTQ+ bankroller Dick Uihlein, spent at least $1.9 million in advertising across Virginia in support of Youngkin and donated $942,000 to the political arm of anti-abortion group Women Speak Out Virginia. Anti-equality group Free to Learn Action launched a $1 million ad campaign spreading widely debunked anti-transgender misinformation in support of Youngkin\u2019s campaign.\n\nAbout 200 major U.S. corporations have stood up and spoken out to oppose anti-transgender legislation being proposed in states across the country. Companies like Amazon, American Airlines, Apple, AT&T, AirBnB, Dell, Dow, Google, IBM, Lyft, Marriott, Microsoft, Nike, and Paypal have objected to these bills. Four of the largest U.S. food companies also condemned \u201cdangerous, discriminatory legislation that serves as an attack on LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly transgender and nonbinary people,\u201d and the Walton Family Foundation issued a statement expressing \u201calarm\u201d at the trend of anti-transgender legislation that recently became law in Arkansas. And more than 60 major companies joined HRC to urge Texas Governor Abbott & elected officials across the country to abandon anti-transgender efforts.\n\nMany are rightly protective of the legacy of women\u2019s sports in this country, and a robust Title IX is central to that legacy. Importantly, advocates for women and girls in sports \u2013 such as the National Women\u2019s Law Center, the Women\u2019s Sports Foundation, Women Leaders in College Sports, and others \u2013 support trans-inclusive policies and oppose efforts to exclude transgender students from participating in sports. So do prominent female athletes including Billie Jean King, Megan Rapinoe, and Cheryl Reeve. That\u2019s because while there are real issues facing women\u2019s sports, including a lack of resources devoted to supporting them, transgender participation in athletics is not one of them.\n\nThe nation\u2019s leading child health and welfare groups representing more than 7 million youth-serving professionals and more than 1,000 child welfare organizations released an open letter calling for lawmakers in states across the country to oppose dozens of bills that target LGBTQ+ people, and transgender children in particular.\n\nNearly 550 college athletes have stood up to anti-transgender legislation by demanding the NCAA pull championships from states that have enacted anti-trans sports laws.\n\nTrans Equality Is Popular Across All Demographics\n\nThe reality is that however sensational and polarizing this issue may seem, public opinion polling across the country show strong support for trans-inclusive and pro-equality policies:\n\nRecent PRRI data shows a large majority of Americans (82%) favor laws that protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination in jobs, public accommodations, and housing, and majorities of Republicans (67%), independents (85%), and Democrats (92%) favor nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ+ Americans.\n\nA PBS/NPR/Marist poll states that 67% of Americans, including 66% of Republicans, oppose the anti-transgender sports ban legislation proliferating across 30 states.\n\nIn a 10-swing-state poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group in 2020 showed:\n\u2022 None At least 60% of Trump voters across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should be able to live freely and openly.\n\u2022 None At least 87% of respondents across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should have equal access to medical care, with many states breaking 90% support\n\u2022 None When respondents were asked about how they prioritized the importance of banning transgender people from participating in sports as compared to other policy issues, the issue came in dead last, with between 1% and 3% prioritizing the issue.\n\nAnother poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group revealed that, with respect to transgender youth participation in sports, the public\u2019s strong inclination is on the side of fairness and equality for transgender student athletes. 73% of voters agree that \u201csports are important in young people\u2019s lives. Young transgender people should be allowed opportunities to participate in a way that is safe and comfortable for them.\u201d\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign is America\u2019s largest civil rights organization working to achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people.

The Kansas Senate passed Senate Bill 208, another anti-trans sports ban, last week. Both bills are now in the House and await a hearing date.\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox and Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb both vetoed similar bills in their states this week, rejecting discriminatory anti-transgender sports bans approved by their state legislatures. Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly vetoed Senate Bill 55, a bill nearly identical to SB 484 and SB 208, after legislators passed it last year. These types of bills and the incendiary, hurtful language surrounding them have a detrimental impact on Kansas\u2019s vulnerable LGBTQ+ population that is already three times as likely to experience depression and nearly twice as likely to experience anxiety as non-LGBTQ+ Kansans.\n\nHuman Rights Campaign State Legislative Director and Senior Counsel Cathryn Oakley released the following statement in reaction to the Kansas Senate passing SB 484 and SB 208:\n\nIn states around the country, transgender children have been playing sports consistent with their gender identity for years without issue. They are kids who deserve to be able to have fun with their friends, exercise, and learn how to be part of a team. We call on the Kansas House to refuse to engage with this conversation, which is predicated upon misunderstanding, disapproval of, and discrimination against transgender youth. These kids are just kids, and they should be allowed to play.\u201d\n\nThe latest PRRI data show that support for LGBTQ+ rights is on the rise in Kansas and nationwide: 77% of Kansans support nondiscrimination protections, and 57% of Kansans oppose refusal of service on religious grounds. Approximately eight in ten Americans (79%) favor laws that would protect LGBTQ+ people against discrimination in jobs, public accommodations, and housing. This reflects an 11% increase in the proportion of Americans who support nondiscrimination protections since 2015 (71%).\n\nA record number of anti-transgender bills were filed in 2021, largely focused on denying transgender youth the ability to receive gender-affirming care and participate in school athletics programs. Even more anti-transgender legislation is on track to be filed in 2022. There are more than 320 anti-LGBTQ+ bills under consideration in state legislatures across the country. Of those, at least 130 directly target transgender people and approximately half of those (70+ bills) would ban trans youth from participating in school sports consistent with their gender identity.\n\nCaught in the crosshairs of anti-LGBTQ+ elected officials\u2019 divisive political strategy are kids who are simply trying to navigate their adolescence. Transgender youth, like all youth, gain benefits from participating in school athletics: leadership opportunities, better physical and mental health outcomes, self-discipline, self-confidence, teamwork, and, of course, fun \u2013 and they shouldn\u2019t be prevented from participating in school athletics because of who they are.\n\nEven when anti-transgender legislation does not become law, politicians are culpable for the harm they cause to LGBTQ+ people\u2019s wellbeing simply by being subjected to continual legislative attacks on their dignity and humanity. As we saw last month, there are real consequences to the discrimination perpetrated upon LGBTQ+ people, and particuarly transgender youth.\n\nLegislators in a record 34 states introduced 147 anti-transgender bills in 2021, focusing on discriminatory anti-equality measures to drive a wedge between their constituents and score short-term political points. In 2021, legislators in twelve states enacted anti-LGBTQ+ bills despite failing to provide examples of what exactly they were legislating against.\n\nMerely introducing anti-transgender bills and peddling anti-transgender rhetoric has already had a damaging impact, leading to LGBTQ+ youth resources being surreptitiously removed from a government website, 11-year old kids literally having trouble sleeping, and a school district banning graphic novels with a transgender character after a parent's complaint. 2021 and 2020 were the deadliest and second deadliest years on record for trans & gender non-conforming people respectively, with the Human Rights Campaign tracking at least 50 violent deaths in 2021 alone. A new Trevor Project survey shows that a startling 85% of transgender or gender non-binary youth say their mental health has been negatively affected by these legislative attacks.\n\nAnti-transgender content on social media is also a radicalizing issue all by itself. This is in large part because transgender young people are among the most marginalized, voiceless, and defenseless communities in America, and because right-wing arguments play on long-standing mysoginistic, racist, and sexist tropes about gender roles.\n\nThese bills are the result of a concerted effort by right-wing organizations that have been battling against LGBTQ+ progress for years. Across recent elections, one of the key anti-equality groups working to turn back decades of LGBTQ+ progress has been the American Principles Project (APP). APP and its chief underwriter Sam Fieler have invested millions of dollars in support of anti-LGBTQ+ candidates. In 2020, APP spent more than $2.6 million in ad spending in support of anti-equality candidates. In Virginia in 2021, APP spent at least $300,000 on digital advertising in support of Glenn Youngkin\u2019s gubernatorial campaign.\n\nRestoration PAC, run and funded by major anti-LGBTQ+ bankroller Dick Uihlein, spent at least $1.9 million in advertising across Virginia in support of Youngkin and donated $942,000 to the political arm of anti-abortion group Women Speak Out Virginia. Anti-equality group Free to Learn Action launched a $1 million ad campaign spreading widely debunked anti-transgender misinformation in support of Youngkin\u2019s campaign.\n\nAlmost 200 major U.S. corporations have stood up and spoken out to oppose anti-transgender legislation being proposed in states across the country. Companies like Amazon, American Airlines, Apple, AT&T, AirBnB, Dell, Dow, Google, IBM, Lyft, Marriott, Microsoft, Nike, and Paypal have objected to these bills. Four of the largest U.S. food companies also condemned \u201cdangerous, discriminatory legislation that serves as an attack on LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly transgender and nonbinary people,\u201d and the Walton Family Foundation issued a statement expressing \u201calarm\u201d at the trend of anti-transgender legislation that recently became law in Arkansas. And more than 60 major companies joined HRC to urge Texas Governor Abbott & elected officials across the country to abandon anti-transgender efforts.\n\nMany are rightly protective of the legacy of women\u2019s sports in this country, and a robust Title IX is central to that legacy. Importantly, advocates for women and girls in sports \u2013 such as the National Women\u2019s Law Center, the Women\u2019s Sports Foundation, Women Leaders in College Sports, and others \u2013 support trans-inclusive policies and oppose efforts to exclude transgender students from participating in sports. So do prominent female athletes including Billie Jean King, Megan Rapinoe, and Cheryl Reeve. That\u2019s because while there are real issues facing women\u2019s sports, including a lack of resources devoted to supporting them, transgender participation in athletics is not one of them.\n\nThe nation\u2019s leading child health and welfare groups representing more than 7 million youth-serving professionals and more than 1,000 child welfare organizations released an open letter calling for lawmakers in states across the country to oppose dozens of bills that target LGBTQ+ people, and transgender children in particular.\n\nNearly 550 college athletes have stood up to anti-transgender legislation by demanding the NCAA pull championships from states that have enactedanti-trans sports laws.\n\nTrans Equality Is Popular Across All Demographics\n\nThe reality is that however sensational and polarizing this issue may seem, public opinion polling across the country show strong support for trans-inclusive and pro-equality policies:\n\nRecent PRRI data shows a large majority of Americans (82%) favor laws that protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination in jobs, public accommodations, and housing, and majorities of Republicans (67%), independents (85%), and Democrats (92%) favor nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ+ Americans.\n\nA PBS/NPR/Marist poll states that 67% of Americans, including 66% of Republicans, oppose the anti-transgender sports ban legislation proliferating across 30 states.\n\nIn a 10-swing-state poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group in 2020 showed:\n\u2022 None At least 60% of Trump voters across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should be able to live freely and openly.\n\u2022 None At least 87% of respondents across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should have equal access to medical care, with many states breaking 90% support\n\u2022 None When respondents were asked about how they prioritized the importance of banning transgender people from participating in sports as compared to other policy issues, the issue came in dead last, with between 1% and 3% prioritizing the issue.\n\nAnother poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group revealed that, with respect to transgender youth participation in sports, the public\u2019s strong inclination is on the side of fairness and equality for transgender student athletes. 73% of voters agree that \u201csports are important in young people\u2019s lives. Young transgender people should be allowed opportunities to participate in a way that is safe and comfortable for them.\u201d\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign is America\u2019s largest civil rights organization working to achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people.

Lawmakers Over Passage of Legislation Attacking Transgender Students  Human Rights Campaign", "content": "The Human Rights Campaign uses cookies to improve your site experience. By using this site, you agree to our use of cookies. To learn more, please read our Privacy Policy.\n\nMADISON \u2014 The Human Rights Campaign \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer civil rights organization \u2014 criticized the passage today of legislation by the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Senate that would allow lawsuits to be filed against school districts or school officials over the use of students\u2019 chosen names or pronouns. The passage of the bill comes after a recent survey showed that 72.5% of LGBTQ+ people in Wisconsin had reported experiencing depression in the prior two weeks. Politicians are culpable for the harm they cause by subjecting vulnerable youth to continued legislative attacks.\n\n\n\nThe legislation passed in the Assembly and Senate as AB 963; both chambers are controlled by Republican majorities. The bills are being driven by malicious conservative groups such as the Institute for Reforming Government and the Alliance Defending Freedom, organizations devoted to turning back the clock on LGBTQ+ rights. The Southern Poverty Law Center has designated the ADF as a national hate group for its longstanding opposition to the LGBTQ+ community. Their work includes efforts to criminalize LGBTQ+ relationships, opposing settled laws like marriage equality, and even opposing the repeal of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnti-LGBTQ+ bills Not Supported by Majority of People Polling has shown that the majority of the population is on the side of equality \u2014 supporting non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ+ people. But Republican politicians have seized on anti-equality rhetoric as part of a larger, concerted effort by former Trump officials and far-right media consultants to turn children of color and LGBTQ+ children into chess pieces for political gain. State legislators are weaponizing trans youth and using these bills to score political points, rather than fix an actual problem. These laws are discriminatory and unconstitutional. Caught in the crosshairs of anti-LGBTQ+ elected officials\u2019 divisive political strategy are kids who are simply trying to navigate their adolescence \u2014 kids who face relentless targeting and increased levels of discrimination in their community, as evidenced by the record incidents of fatal violence against transgender and gender non-binary people in 2021. \n\n\n\nThese bills are the result of a concerted effort by right-wing organizations that have been battling against LGBTQ+ progress for years. Across recent elections, one of the key anti-equality groups working to turn back decades of LGBTQ+ progress has been the American Principles Project (APP). APP and its chief underwriter Sam Fieler have invested millions of dollars in support of anti-LGBTQ+ candidates. In 2020, APP spent more than $2.6 million in ad spending in support of anti-equality candidates. In Virginia in 2021, APP spent at least $300,000 on digital advertising in support of Glenn Youngkin\u2019s gubernatorial campaign. Restoration PAC, run and funded by major anti-LGBTQ+ bankroller Dick Uihlein, spent at least $1.9 million in advertising across Virginia in support of Youngkin and donated $942,000 to the political arm of anti-abortion group Women Speak Out Virginia. Anti-equality group Free to Learn Action launched a $1 million ad campaign spreading widely debunked anti-transgender misinformation in support of Youngkin\u2019s campaign.\n\n\n\nMore than 150 major U.S. corporations have stood up and spoken out to oppose anti-transgender legislation being proposed in states across the country. Companies like Amazon, American Airlines, Apple, AT&T, AirBnB, Dell, Dow, Google, IBM, Lyft, Marriott, Microsoft, Nike, and Paypal have objected to these bills. Four of the largest U.S. food companies also condemned \u201cdangerous, discriminatory legislation that serves as an attack on LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly transgender and nonbinary people,\u201d and the Walton Family Foundation issued a statement expressing \u201calarm\u201d at the trend of anti-transgender legislation that recently became law in Arkansas. Many are rightly protective of the legacy of women\u2019s sports in this country, and a robust Title IX is central to that legacy. Importantly, advocates for women and girls in sports \u2013 such as the National Women\u2019s Law Center, the Women\u2019s Sports Foundation, Women Leaders in College Sports, and others \u2013 support trans-inclusive policies and oppose efforts to exclude transgender students from participating in sports. So do prominent female athletes including Billie Jean King, Megan Rapinoe, and Cheryl Reeve. That\u2019s because while there are real issues facing women\u2019s sports, including a lack of resources devoted to supporting them, transgender participation in athletics is not one of them. The nation\u2019s leading child health and welfare groups representing more than 7 million youth-serving professionals and more than 1,000 child welfare organizations released an open letter calling for lawmakers in states across the country to oppose dozens of bills that target LGBTQ+ people, and transgender children in particular. Nearly 550 college athletes have stood up to anti-transgender legislation by demanding the NCAA pull championships from states that have enacted anti-trans sports laws.\n\n\n\nTrans Equality Is Popular Across All Demographics The reality is that however sensational and polarizing this issue may seem, public opinion polling across the country showed strong support for trans-inclusive and pro-equality policies: Recent PRRI data shows a large majority of Americans (82%) favor laws that protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination in jobs, public accommodations, and housing, and majorities of Republicans (67%), independents (85%), and Democrats (92%) favor nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ+ Americans. A PBS/NPR/Marist poll states that 67% of Americans, including 66% of Republicans, oppose the anti-transgender sports ban legislation proliferating across 30 states. In a 10-swing-state poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group in 2020 showed:\n\u2022 None At least 60% of Trump voters across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should be able to live freely and openly.\n\u2022 None At least 87% of respondents across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should have equal access to medical care, with many states breaking 90% support\n\u2022 None When respondents were asked about how they prioritized the importance of banning transgender people from participating in sports as compared to other policy issues, the issue came in dead last, with between 1% and 3% prioritizing the issue. Another poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group revealed that, with respect to transgender youth participation in sports, the public\u2019s strong inclination is on the side of fairness and equality for transgender student-athletes. 73% of voters agree that \u201csports are important in young people\u2019s lives. Young transgender people should be allowed opportunities to participate in a way that is safe and comfortable for them.\u201d", "medium": "Article", "links":

More than three in four Americans (76%) favor laws protecting LGTBQ+ Americans from discrimination. Yet many lawmakers are chipping away at LGBTQ+ equality, increasing the risks to our community\u2019s safety. Last week, Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced the state would investigate the loving, affirming families of trans children as child abusers. This week, the investigations are already underway.\n\nTerrified Texas parents are frantically creating \u201csafety folders\u201d and contingency plans, preparing their children for potential questioning by state officials. Anyone can report a family for suspicion of child abuse - an important provision because actual child abuse is a horrific crime. But the American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, Texas Pediatric Society and Texas Medical Association, as well as other medical professionals, child care advocates, educators and mental health experts, all unequivocally state that gender-affirming care is NOT child abuse. Loving your trans child and accepting them for who they authentically are is NOT child abuse. Yet under the directive from Gov. Abbott, anyone can report a family with a trans child as child abusers and the state must investigate.\n\nAnother consequence of this action is that it has pushed trans children and their families into hiding, forcing them to lower their public profiles and silence their voices. Families are canceling plans to speak out publicly, withdrawing op-eds and deleting public posts against the governor\u2019s action out of fear the visibility would make them a target for politically-motivated child abuse reports.\n\nHRC Texas State Director Rebecca Marques joined partner organizations and allies last week at a press conference on the steps of a Texas courthouse. The mother of a transgender child had been scheduled to speak about her family\u2019s decision, a year in the making, to leave Texas. She was forced to cancel out of fear her family would be targeted as a result of her public appearance. She instead sent a statement to be read by Texas Freedom Network\u2019s Marti Bier that included the following:\n\n\u201cIt has taken a year of planning and significant resources to be able to [leave] and we have left feeling fortunate to at least have the means to flee our home and the ability to protect our child from our own government. So many families do not have the ability to leave and no one should ever be faced with the difficult decision to uproot their life to protect their children in America \u2026 but leaving is the only choice for our family. We are choosing to grieve the loss of our home instead of the loss of our child.\u201d\n\nIn hopeful news, a judge in Travis County, Texas, issued a temporary restraining order last week that blocks the state\u2019s child-welfare agency from investigating a family for child abuse because they provided gender-affirming medical care to their teen daughter. The family that was under investigation was the family of a state worker at that same agency. The ruling was in response to a lawsuit filed on behalf of the state worker\u2019s family, and applies only to them. It could potentially lead to a statewide injunction, which would apply to all investigations. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights is encouraging Texans affected by Abbott\u2019s directive to file complaints and is reminding healthcare providers that federal health privacy laws forbid disclosure of private medical information.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening to transgender children in Texas is horrific \u2014 and while the approach may be unique to Texas, the anti-trans animus is not. Transgender children are being targeted by state legislatures across the country. Alabama is on the precipice of passing its own law making it a felony to provide gender-affirming care to youth.\n\nAnti-trans sports bans are moving particularly quickly. In total, more than 56 anti-trans sports bans are active in the 46 legislatures currently in session. Anti-trans sports bans have already been signed into law in South Dakota and Iowa, and one is awaiting the governor\u2019s signature in Indiana.\n\nAlabama, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah and Wisconsin are on the verge of passing anti-transgender bills into laws in the coming days. And Florida is expected to soon pass two bills that more broadly impact all LGBTQ+ youth.\n\nThe efforts of anti-LGBTQ+ legislators are relentless, and we must be tireless in our advocacy against them. When families themselves do not feel safe to speak, we must be even louder.\n\nThat\u2019s why HRC\u2019s Parents for Transgender Equality Council collected signatures from more than 7,000 parents and people across the country who condemn the avalanche of anti-transgender legislation moving in legislatures across the United States. They know it\u2019s important to speak out and to continue speaking out.

Greg Abbott directing Texas\u2019s Department of Family and Protective Services to consider best-practice, age-appropriate, medically-necessary, gender-affirming care for transgender children as child abuse \u2014 parents of transgender young people and national organizations \u2013 including medical, education, and mental health organizations \u2013 are speaking out against anti-trans policies Texas and across the country.\n\nSouth Dakota has already passed one anti-transgender law this year, and Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin are on the verge of passing anti-transgender bills in the coming days. Additionally, Florida is considering two bills that more broadly impact all LGBTQ+ youth. These bills are the result of a concerted effort by right-wing extremists and organizations like Steve Bannon and the American Principles Project, that have been battling against progress for LGBTQ+ people for years\n\n\n\nHouston Chronicle: Abbott and Paxton, don't threaten parents of trans kids and their doctors:\n\n\u201c[Abbott, Paxton are]hurting the children by threatening doctors and parents, and also offending the sensibilities of any Texan who still believes in personal freedom and limited government. There\u2019s nothing more personal than health decisions affecting one\u2019s own body and nothing more worthy of condemnation than government\u2019s intrusion on those decisions.\u201d\n\nPhysicians Oppose Texas Efforts to Interfere in the Patient-Physician Relationship and Criminalize Gender-Affirming Care:\n\n\u201cOur organizations, representing nearly 600,000 physicians and medical students, strongly oppose efforts, in Texas or anywhere else, to criminalize gender-affirming care\u2026 Patients, including youth, must be able to discuss gender affirming care with their trusted physician to determine together what care is best for them.\u201d\n\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, Texas Pediatric Society Oppose Actions in Texas Threatening Health of Transgender Youth:\n\n\"Pediatricians are trusted by parents to provide the care their children need to be healthy and thrive. What is happening in Texas directly undermines the care pediatricians provide their patients. This harmful directive leaves families seeking gender-affirming care in Texas with nowhere to turn. Pediatricians could be investigated for child abuse by simply providing evidence-based, medically necessary services. Gender affirming care is not abuse. Politics has no place in the exam room. All children deserve access to the care they need.\"\n\nTexas State Teachers Association and National Education Association Presidents jointly respond to Texas Governor Greg Abbott\u2019s attack on transgender students:\n\n\u201cNo parent should worry that their child\u2019s gender-affirming \u2013 and sometimes lifesaving \u2013 care is criminalized because of bigotry and misinformation. By stoking fear, Gov. Abbott is attempting to distract and divide us so we will not notice his failures to provide what our students and families need \u2013 inclusive, safe, and fully resourced schools\u201d\n\nNational Association of Social Workers Condemns Efforts to Redefine Child Abuse to Include Gender-Affirming Care:\n\n\u201cThe continued attempts in Texas to change the definition of child abuse are in direct opposition to social work values, principles, and Code of Ethics and pose an imminent danger to transgender youth and their families. Furthermore, these shameful actions undermine the established truth supported by every credible medical and mental health organization in the country that the concepts of sexual orientation and gender identity are real and irrefutable components of one\u2019s individual identity.\n\nWhat is transpiring in Texas is tragically only part of a larger anti-LGBTQ+ movement taking place across the nation that is directly aimed at limiting the rights and freedoms of LGBTQ+ people, with a heightened emphasis on the erasure of the human rights and civil liberties of transgender and gender-expansive people. There are more than 266 anti-LGBTQ+ bills under consideration in state legislatures across the country. NASW stands against all efforts to limit the fundamental civil liberties of transgender youth and their access to essential health services.\u201d\n\nBishop C. Andrew \"Andy\" Doyle of the Episcopal Diocese of Texas\n\n\u201cThere is no requirement for anyone to report the existence of trans kids or their parents in one of our Episcopal Churches or schools. The gov\u2019s statement has no force of law. ALL people are welcome in churches of the Episcopal Diocese of Texas without fear - we offer only love.\u201d\n\nPosition Statement of the Ray E. Helfer Society On Gender Affirming Care Being Considered Child Abuse and Neglect:\n\n\u201cThe provision of medical and mental health care, consistent with the standard of care, is in no way consistent with our definitions of child abuse. The medical and mental health evaluation and management of these youth would be in no way enhanced, and likely harmed, by the involvement of a state child protection agency. We advocate for appropriate, scientifically sound medical care for transgender youth and resolutely oppose subjecting their families to threats of involvement in the child protection system or their medical providers to civil or criminal penalties merely for providing optimal treatment to these vulnerable youth.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m the mother of a trans son in Texas \u2014 and no, I\u2019m not a \u2018child abuser\u2019:\n\n\u201cFor years, I\u2019ve been begging people to pay attention to what\u2019s happening to trans children. But these precious kids, who are literally fighting for their lives, have been ignored. The result? An escalation both in the number of bills filed in states across the country \u2014 79 anti-trans measures in 2020, 147 in 2021 and roughly 280 (so far) on track to be filed in state legislatures in 2022 \u2014 and in the cruelty of the content: putting parents in an impossible situation by forcing them to choose between providing medically necessary, lifesaving care, or facing the threat that their children will be taken from them.\u201d\n\nThis Texas mom says she's moving her family to California to protect her transgender daughter:\n\n\u201cThe general feeling (in Texas) is just constant fear.

Abbott and A.G. Paxton\u2019s unprecedented efforts to prevent transgender youth from accessing best-practice, age-appropriate, medically-necessary, gender-affirming care goes against every major medical and mental health organization in the country \u2013 each of which supports gender-affirming care for transgender and non-binary people. Many national and Texas-based organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Texas State Teachers Association, National Education Association, and the National Association of Social Workers, have all spoken out.\n\nToday\u2019s event comes as more than 7,000 people from all 50 U.S. states and Washington D.C. joined the Human Rights Campaign in an open letter condemning the avalanche of anti-transgender legislation moving in legislatures across the country.\n\nWHAT THEY\u2019RE SAYING ABOUT GOV. ABBOTT\u2019S ORDER:\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be here today to speak because my family is scared and worried that speaking publicly could lead to a criminal investigation. That sounds outlandish but it is a reality for many Texas families.\n\nWe began the process of leaving Texas last year after the hearing for Senate Bill 1646 \u2013 a bill criminalizing affirming parents of transgender children as child abusers\u2026 We will be gone soon, to a state with explicit protections for trans kids and adults. We are leaving behind our family, our friends, and our community. We are leaving behind the city where my husband and I have both been raised and where we started our family. We are leaving the home we thought we would raise our children to adulthood in.\n\nWe never imagined we would become political targets in our own state\u2026 No one should ever face the difficult decision to uproot their life to protect their children in America. We are choosing to grieve the loss of our home instead of the loss of our child.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe assault on our community, our extended family has not ended. Here we are in court once again to defend our humanity, to warn about the unconstitutionality of the witch hunt to persecute loving families and it\u2019s frankly exhausting.\n\nEvery trans and LGBTQ+ person regardless of race, class, gender, sexual orientation or ability deserves to live happy and authentic lives without government intrusion.\n\nThere are thousands of people across Texas who are fighting for your right to exist authentically and safely in this state and we will not give up.\u201d\n\n\u201cPaxton and Abbott do not scare us and will never separate us. Texans deserve so much better than egocentric leaders who don\u2019t care about the children who call Texas home. Our message to them is loud and clear: transgender children are a blessing and we will fight back against your cursed views.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Abbott\u2019s approach is unique to Texas, the effort to limit the rights of transgender people is not. Across the country, this year alone, more than 125 anti-trans bills have been introduced. It\u2019s all part of a coordinated effort by anti-LGBTQ+ extremists. For every bill introduced, the transgender community suffers. Every headline, every hearing, every minute spent worrying about these efforts increases depression, isolation, stress and fear for transgender children, teens, adults and the people who love them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter coming out at the age of 17, it took me nearly 3 years to access medically necessary, best practice, life-saving, and gender-affirming health care. And it saved my life.\n\nAll people, regardless of their race, background, or gender should be able to access the healthcare that they need to thrive. Transgender Texans should be able to access medically necessary, lifesaving care. Denying this to our community is pure discrimination.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be who we are, unapologetically, openly, and courageously \u2013 for you to recognize your truth \u2013 and to have your parents love and support you is a special thing. Parents, hang in there. We are fighting. We will not rest until we see dignity, we see respect, and we see freedom for our transgender community here in Texas. Adults and children alike.\n\nWe are done being kicked around by those supposed to protect us, people we elect into these seats, that face a responsibility to their community, to Texas \u2013 a responsibility to lead us in a way that benefits the state, that benefits its people, and that doesn\u2019t hurt people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believed trans kids in Texas were safe \u2013 at least until the next legislative session. This week hit me like a ton of bricks.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbbott and the people who support and enable him have taken away some of my joy and my peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a political stunt, people tell me. They\u2019re right. And I hope voters keep that in mind \u2013 that Abbot and Paxton are willing to harm children for political gain. That these two men are willing to break up Texas families just to score political points.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy family is devastated \u2013 too in shock to process a state-sanctioned witch hunt against us resulting in my child being removed from my home and put into foster care.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have tried to stay positive, but it\u2019s hard when you feel like you are in an abusive relationship with your home state. I am exhausted, anxious, scared, and most of all angry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes me physically ill to have to imagine having to flee this state.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am relieved that we are moving out of state and filled with anxiety for everyone who can\u2019t escape this nightmare.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Gov. Abbott took the unprecedented move of directing Texas\u2019s Department of Family and Protective Services to consider best-practice, age-appropriate, medically-necessary, gender-affirming care for transgender children as child abuse. Abbott\u2019s letter follows the release of a legal opinion by Attorney General Paxton - which is not legally binding - that opined the same.\n\nGovernor Abbott and Attorney General Paxton\u2019s unprecedented efforts are craven, politically motivated attempts to criminalize healthcare decisions made between parents, medical experts, and transgender youth. Every major medical and mental health organization in the country supports gender-affirming care for transgender and non-binary people, and Prevent Child Abuse America has condemned the Attorney General\u2019s opinion.\n\nThis most recent attack on transgender youth comes via executive action, but transgender youth have been under attack in state legislatures for several years. A record number of anti-transgender bills were filed in 2021, largely focused on denying transgender youth the ability to receive gender-affirming care and participate in school athletics programs. Even more anti-transgender legislation is on track to be filed in 2022. South Dakota has already passed one anti-transgender law this year, and Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin are on the verge of passing anti-transgender bills in the coming days. Additionally, Florida is considering two bills that more broadly impact all LGBTQ+ youth.\n\nEven when anti-transgender legislation does not become law, politicians are culpable for the harm they cause to LGBTQ+ people\u2019s wellbeing simply by being subjected to continual legislative attacks on their dignity and humanity. As we saw just last week, there are real consequences to the discrimination perpetrated upon LGBTQ+ people, and particuarly transgender youth.\n\nAnti-transgender legislation also affects business\u2019 bottom lines \u2013 having widespread negative impacts on the workforce, ability to recruit, and productivity. As a result, 150+ businesses have signed a Business Statement Opposing Anti-LGBTQ+ Legislation, to take a clear stance against such legislation.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2022/aap-texas-pediatric-society-oppose-actions-in-texas-threatening-health-of-transgender-youth/", "https://twitter.com/HRC/status/1494699581757702153?s=20&t=jsjjJTsxq5SC9FMWe1i02Q", "https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUVR8R9-2FCuVErVco88BrXfx-2B4VrkLds3Buln9vxkLQCWbOti3ee4NW8EN2L82uuUX5JSpqHxYNE6ZNbx8v7YzPqSGe7U-2BH5jY-2FolkqTy36hoa2HVRIZbszF9fRNz3kuTfoXReAPcpWcEHXF7xxB4sA8A-3Dn7kw_SwQzVbHIfFE9uWxeRIZUf-2FZBLE-2FQdGlrg7z5Yc6TBXKTYXGzO9jqYJ5KpTjGvI1Wti2DTHYhUUr9yl634WyNGTEQdPszShKIHqrSl9PmVmSdx4uSllefeZASXZl72djD7w8wKib8ZW-2FsCwlwkWdtGdMyt9ugDhFFZwTh9YnJcbpal3aYAXclelj5Xa1VrGspmW5mRTUqlPfEJqzAeLW98pxQxquOXwFeHUduzS49l9WP6nnu5RkIyn2aHj5tvUdufwl8WnVyRAIXgbGsnzksol7UkAYd4ryZpnBuGYeVKYI6VoQffBQVuSAPDJQkVckWUUL8KI8mDvlff1-2F0-2FCcQh-2BGLGh3YljdYtKro8ugjjNw-3D", "https://twitter.com/HRC/status/1494699588510527495?s=20&t=jsjjJTsxq5SC9FMWe1i02Q", "https://www.hrc.org/resources/business-statement-on-anti-lgbtq-state-legislation", "https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/thousands-of-parents-join-human-rights-campaign-in-condemning-state-attacks-on-transgender-and-non-binary-youth", "https://preventchildabuse.org/latest-activity/gender-affirming-care/", "https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/human-rights-campaign-condemns-anti-equality-extremist-governor-greg-abbott-and-attorney-general-ken-paxton-for-putting-the-well-being-of-transgender-youth-at-risk", "https://fb.watch/bvAqdf1TQf/", "https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUdJxh7pZ98JMfuOwgDa8QXqD7OfSkAcWMqRVPMjeWsmZMfZD4lXEwBa20nD3SSJv6JQ07FIScVR3kVCaRSWPSopuCMS1OAi83ne5-2BfnAynUlRhCHxxAC-2FOiGWRjksLvyThk6M6BucB339-2FMAiFl2RQH1JqLYx4bY0Ye0PxqpFodRO1mp_SwQzVbHIfFE9uWxeRIZUf-2FZBLE-2FQdGlrg7z5Yc6TBXKTYXGzO9jqYJ5KpTjGvI1Wti2DTHYhUUr9yl634WyNGTEQdPszShKIHqrSl9PmVmSdx4uSllefeZASXZl72djD7w8wKib8ZW-2FsCwlwkWdtGdMyt9ugDhFFZwTh9YnJcbpal3aYAXclelj5Xa1VrGspmW5mRTUqlPfEJqzAeLW98noxluI65salfuNs9U2soq1TPEjjS1rintYRJYTEBHbqxRrcWp8jBZBcTVGNVTbEf6NZz-2Fdy-2BLWFi9RJXT0VD9sdZ52M8ukhb3MEeTCUXUOkz5hwJGIEZH6DEtNdGpLw6qdINYpU7EAtTgsnMywJLGE-3D", "https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/zLatest_News/AACAP_Statement_Opposing_Actions_in_Texas.aspx"], "labels": [{"name": "Non-news"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "transgender people", "weight": 0.101136826}, {"name": "transgender children", "weight": 0.09940097}, {"name": "Anti-transgender legislation", "weight": 0.093488894}, {"name": "anti-transgender legislation", "weight": 0.093488894}, {"name": "anti-transgender bills", "weight": 0.09108863}, {"name": "transgender youth", "weight": 0.09105519}, {"name": "Transgender Texans", "weight": 0.07881517}, {"name": "Texas families", "weight": 0.07788681}, {"name": "many Texas families", "weight": 0.07293623}, {"name": "Anti-LGBTQ+ Legislation", "weight": 0.070925176}], "topics": [{"name": "LGBTQ"}, {"name": "Social Issues"}, {"name": "Trans Rights"}], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "The Human Rights Campaign", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Equality Texas", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "TFN", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "ACLU", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "TENT", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Lambda Legal", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the American Academy of Pediatrics", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "National Education Association", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Department of Family and Protective Services", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Prevent Child Abuse America", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Travis County Courthouse", "type": "FAC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Greg Abbott", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 10}, {"data": "Ken Paxton", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "A.G.

Additionally, Louisiana does not include gender identity as a protected characteristic in its hate crimes law. Louisiana\u2019s legislative session begins this month and state legislators have prefiled a bill that would ban transgender athletes from participating in school sports. Though we have recently seen some political gains that support and affirm transgender people, we have also faced anti-LGBTQ+ attacks at many levels of government this year. As of this writing, more than 200 anti-LGBTQ+ bills are under consideration in state legislatures across the country, more than 90 of which directly target transgender people.\n\nWe must demand better from our elected officials and reject harmful anti-transgender legislation at the local, state and federal levels, while also considering every possible way to make ending this violence a reality.

The intersections of racism, transphobia, sexism, biphobia and homophobia conspire to deprive them of necessities to live and thrive, so we must all work together to cultivate acceptance, reject hate and end stigma for everyone in the trans and gender non-conforming community.\n\nIn addition to the incidents of fatal violence that we track each year, HRC monitors several concerning deaths of transgender and gender non-conforming people where details are unclear. We call for further investigation into these cases, which currently stand at 14--7 of which occurred in 2021. You may find a list of these cases here.\n\nIn order to work towards this goal and combat stigma against transgender and non-binary people, HRC has collaborated with WarnerMedia on a PSA campaign to lift up their voices and stories. Learn more and watch the PSAs here.\n\nHRC has also launched the \u201cCount Me In\u201d campaign to encourage everyone, LGBTQ+ people and allies, to get loud, get visible and spread awareness on behalf of transgender and non-binary people. The more people who show they care, including allies and trans and non-binary people who speak up for the most marginalized in our community, the more hearts and minds we will change. Learn more and take action at hrc.org/CountMeIn.\n\nIn the pursuit of greater accuracy and respect, HRC offers guidelines for journalists and others who report on transgender people. HRC, Media Matters and the Trans Journalists Association have also partnered on an FAQ for reporters writing about anti-trans violence.

In her remarks, she claimed, \u201cRepublicans believe that parents matter.\u201d Today, however, Iowa Republicans are standing on the precipice of enacting one of the broadest bans in the country prohibiting transgender girls and women from playing sports. During debate in the Iowa House of Representatives last month, one lawmaker repeatedly argued that transgender girls are mentally ill and compared them to individuals struggling with substance abuse and cancer patients. Since then, Reynolds, who first called for passage of a discriminatory anti-transgender bill last May, has done nothing to distance herself from this incendiary, hurtful language that has a detrimental impact on a vulnerable LGBT population that is already twice as likely to experience anxiety or depression as non-LGBT Iowans.\n\nTransgender youth, like all youth, gain benefits from participating in school athletics: leadership opportunities, better physical and mental health outcomes, self-discipline, self-confidence, teamwork, and, of course, fun \u2013 and they shouldn\u2019t be prevented from participating in school athletics because of who they are.\n\nThe legislative fight to pass discriminatory anti-transgender legislation has already been fast and furious this year, led by national groups aiming to stymie LGBTQ+ progress made on the national level and in many states. There are so far more than 266 anti-LGBTQ+ bills under consideration in state legislatures across the country. Of those, at least 125 directly target transgender people and nearly half of those (57+ bills) would ban trans youth from participating in school sports consistent with their gender identity.\n\nCaught in the crosshairs of anti-LGBTQ+ elected officials\u2019 divisive political strategy are kids who are simply trying to navigate their adolescence \u2014 kids who face relentless targeting and increased levels of discrimination in their community, as evidenced by the record incidents of fatal violence against transgender and gender non-binary people in 2021.\n\nLegislators in a record 34 states introduced 147 anti-transgender bills in 2021, focusing on discriminatory anti-equality measures to drive a wedge between their constituents and score short-term political points. In 2021, legislators in twelve states enacted anti-LGBTQ+ bills despite failing to provide examples of what exactly they were legislating against.\n\nMerely introducing anti-transgender bills and peddling anti-transgender rhetoric has already had a damaging impact, leading to LGBTQ+ youth resources being surreptitiously removed from a government website, 11-year old kids literally having trouble sleeping, and a school district banning graphic novels with a transgender character after a parent's complaint. 2021 and 2020 were the deadliest and second deadliest years on record for trans & gender non-conforming people respectively, with the Human Rights Campaign tracking at least 50 violent deaths in 2021 alone. A new Trevor Project survey shows that a startling 85% of transgender or gender non-binary youth say their mental health has been negatively affected by these legislative attacks.\n\nAnti-transgender content on social media is also a radicalizing issue all by itself. This is in large part because transgender young people are among the most marginalized, voiceless, and defenseless communities in America, and because right-wing arguments play on long-standing mysoginistic, racist, and sexist tropes about gender roles.\n\nThese bills are the result of a concerted effort by right-wing organizations that have been battling against LGBTQ+ progress for years. Across recent elections, one of the key anti-equality groups working to turn back decades of LGBTQ+ progress has been the American Principles Project (APP). APP and its chief underwriter Sam Fieler have invested millions of dollars in support of anti-LGBTQ+ candidates. In 2020, APP spent more than $2.6 million in ad spending in support of anti-equality candidates. In Virginia in 2021, APP spent at least $300,000 on digital advertising in support of Glenn Youngkin\u2019s gubernatorial campaign.\n\nRestoration PAC, run and funded by major anti-LGBTQ+ bankroller Dick Uihlein, spent at least $1.9 million in advertising across Virginia in support of Youngkin and donated $942,000 to the political arm of anti-abortion group Women Speak Out Virginia. Anti-equality group Free to Learn Action launched a $1 million ad campaign spreading widely debunked anti-transgender misinformation in support of Youngkin\u2019s campaign.\n\nMore than 150 major U.S. corporations have stood up and spoken out to oppose anti-transgender legislation being proposed in states across the country. Companies like Amazon, American Airlines, Apple, AT&T, AirBnB, Dell, Dow, Google, IBM, Lyft, Marriott, Microsoft, Nike, and Paypal have objected to these bills. Four of the largest U.S. food companies also condemned \u201cdangerous, discriminatory legislation that serves as an attack on LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly transgender and nonbinary people,\u201d and the Walton Family Foundation issued a statement expressing \u201calarm\u201d at the trend of anti-transgender legislation that recently became law in Arkansas.\n\nMany are rightly protective of the legacy of women\u2019s sports in this country, and a robust Title IX is central to that legacy. Importantly, advocates for women and girls in sports \u2013 such as the National Women\u2019s Law Center, the Women\u2019s Sports Foundation, Women Leaders in College Sports, and others \u2013 support trans-inclusive policies and oppose efforts to exclude transgender students from participating in sports. So do prominent female athletes including Billie Jean King, Megan Rapinoe, and Cheryl Reeve. That\u2019s because while there are real issues facing women\u2019s sports, including a lack of resources devoted to supporting them, transgender participation in athletics is not one of them.\n\nThe nation\u2019s leading child health and welfare groups representing more than 7 million youth-serving professionals and more than 1,000 child welfare organizations released an open letter calling for lawmakers in states across the country to oppose dozens of bills that target LGBTQ+ people, and transgender children in particular.\n\nNearly 550 college athletes have stood up to anti-transgender legislation by demanding the NCAA pull championships from states that have enacted anti-trans sports laws.\n\nTrans Equality Is Popular Across All Demographics\n\nThe reality is that however sensational and polarizing this issue may seem, public opinion polling across the country show strong support for trans-inclusive and pro-equality policies:\n\nRecent PRRI data shows a large majority of Americans (82%) favor laws that protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination in jobs, public accommodations, and housing, and majorities of Republicans (67%), independents (85%), and Democrats (92%) favor nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ+ Americans.\n\nA PBS/NPR/Marist poll states that 67% of Americans, including 66% of Republicans, oppose the anti-transgender sports ban legislation proliferating across 30 states.\n\nIn a 10-swing-state poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group in 2020 showed:\n\u2022 None At least 60% of Trump voters across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should be able to live freely and openly.\n\u2022 None At least 87% of respondents across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should have equal access to medical care, with many states breaking 90% support\n\u2022 None When respondents were asked about how they prioritized the importance of banning transgender people from participating in sports as compared to other policy issues, the issue came in dead last, with between 1% and 3% prioritizing the issue.\n\nAnother poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group revealed that, with respect to transgender youth participation in sports, the public\u2019s strong inclination is on the side of fairness and equality for transgender student athletes. 73% of voters agree that \u201csports are important in young people\u2019s lives. Young transgender people should be allowed opportunities to participate in a way that is safe and comfortable for them.\u201d\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign is America\u2019s largest civil rights organization working to achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people. HRC envisions a world where LGBTQ+ people are embraced as full members of society at home, at work and in every community.", "medium": "Article", "links":

The list of signatories has more than tripled in the past year and represents tens of thousands of employees in the state of Alabama.\n\nBusiness leaders consistently report that they have difficulty with recruitment, retention, and tourism in states that debate or pass legislation that excludes LGBTQ+ people from full participation in daily life, and that includes the children of their valued employees and recruits. These policy fights negatively impact businesses operationally and financially, and needlessly put the safety and wellbeing of their team members and their families at risk.\n\nLast year, a record 26 anti-LGBTQ+ bills were enacted into law across ten states. In 2022, at least 160 anti-LGBTQ bills are already pending in state legislatures, more than half of which specifically target transgender youth and ban them from being able to fully participate in everyday life. Lawmakers from coast to coast are seeking to ban transgender youth from participating in sports; criminalize medically necessary, life-saving healthcare for transgender youth; ban discussion of LGBTQ youth and families in classrooms, effectively erasing our community; revive \u201cbathroom bills\u201d to prohibit transgender young people from simply using the restroom at school; and even undermine companies\u2019 own internal inclusion and safe workplace programs.\n\nThe business statement reads as follows:\n\nThe companies joining this statement do business, create jobs, and serve customers throughout the United States. Our businesses strongly embrace diversity and inclusion because we want everyone who works for us or does business with us to feel included and welcomed as their true, authentic selves. Fairness, equal treatment, and opportunity are central to our corporate values because we care about our employees and the customers we serve. What\u2019s more, these values also matter to our bottom lines. Inclusive business practices lead to more productive and engaged employees, increased customer satisfaction; and, ultimately, improved competitiveness and financial performance.\n\nWe are deeply concerned by the bills being introduced in state houses across the country that single out LGBTQ individuals - many specifically targeting transgender youth - for exclusion or differential treatment. Laws that would affect access to medical care for transgender people, parental rights, social and family services, student sports, or access to public facilities such as restrooms, unnecessarily and uncharitably single out already marginalized groups for additional disadvantage.

A report by the HRC Foundation, \u201cAn Epidemic of Violence 2021,\u201d found that between 2013 and 2021, approximately two thirds of transgender and gender non-conforming people with known killers had their lives taken by an acquaintance, friend, family member or intimate partner. Intimate partners specifically accounted for over a fifth (21%) of all known perpetrators\u2013and it is likely this may even be an undercount. To date, the relationship of the victim to the killer is still unknown for a plurality (43%) of all identified cases of fatal violence.\n\nAdditionally, according to the 2015 United States Transgender Survey, 54% of transgender and non-binary people have experienced some form of intimate partner violence in their life. Last year, HRC released a report, titled \u201cLGBTQ Intimate Partner Violence and COVID-19,\u201d which details the increased risk of interpersonal violence faced by LGBTQ+ people that has been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAt the state level, transgender and gender non-conforming people in Texas are not protected from discrimination in employment, housing, education and public spaces. While Texas does include sexual orientation as a protected characteristic in its hate crimes law, it does not expressly include gender identity. Though we have recently seen some political gains that support and affirm transgender people, we have also faced anti-LGBTQ+ attacks at many levels of government this year. As of this writing, more than 200 anti-LGBTQ+ bills are under consideration in state legislatures across the country, more than 90 of which directly target transgender people.\n\nWe must demand better from our elected officials and reject harmful anti-transgender legislation at the local, state and federal levels, while also considering every possible way to make ending this violence a reality. It is clear that fatal violence disproportionately affects transgender women of color, especially Black transgender women. The intersections of racism, transphobia, sexism, biphobia and homophobia conspire to deprive them of necessities to live and thrive, so we must all work together to cultivate acceptance, reject hate and end stigma for everyone in the trans and gender non-conforming community.\n\nIn addition to the incidents of fatal violence that we track each year, HRC monitors several concerning deaths of transgender and gender non-conforming people where details are unclear. We call for further investigation into these cases, which currently stand at 14. You may find a list of these cases here.\n\nIn order to work towards this goal and combat stigma against transgender and non-binary people, HRC has collaborated with WarnerMedia on a PSA campaign to lift up their voices and stories. Learn more and watch the PSAs here.\n\nHRC has also launched the \u201cCount Me In\u201d campaign to encourage everyone, LGBTQ+ people and allies, to get loud, get visible and spread awareness on behalf of transgender and non-binary people. The more people who show they care, including allies and trans and non-binary people who speak up for the most marginalized in our community, the more hearts and minds we will change.

There are so far more than 266 anti-LGBTQ+ bills under consideration in state legislatures across the country. Of those, at least 125 directly target transgender people and nearly half of those (57+ bills) would ban trans youth from participating in school sports consistent with their gender identity.\n\nCaught in the crosshairs of anti-LGBTQ+ elected officials\u2019 divisive political strategy are kids who are simply trying to navigate their adolescence \u2014 kids who face relentless targeting and increased levels of discrimination in their community, as evidenced by the record incidents of fatal violence against transgender and gender non-binary people in 2021.\n\nLegislators in a record 34 states introduced 147 anti-transgender bills in 2021, focusing on discriminatory anti-equality measures to drive a wedge between their constituents and score short-term political points. In 2021, legislators in twelve states enacted anti-LGBTQ+ bills despite failing to provide examples of what exactly they were legislating against.\n\nMerely introducing anti-transgender bills and peddling anti-transgender rhetoric has already had a damaging impact, leading to LGBTQ+ youth resources being surreptitiously removed from a government website, 11-year old kids literally having trouble sleeping, and a school district banning graphic novels with a transgender character after a parent's complaint. 2021 and 2020 were the deadliest and second deadliest years on record for trans & gender non-conforming people respectively, with the Human Rights Campaign tracking at least 50 violent deaths in 2021 alone. A new Trevor Project survey shows that a startling 85% of transgender or gender non-binary youth say their mental health has been negatively affected by these legislative attacks.\n\nAnti-transgender content on social media is also a radicalizing issue all by itself. This is in large part because transgender young people are among the most marginalized, voiceless, and defenseless communities in America, and because right-wing arguments play on long-standing misogynistic, racist, and sexist tropes about gender roles.\n\nThese bills are the result of a concerted effort by right-wing organizations that have been battling against LGBTQ+ progress for years. Across recent elections, one of the key anti-equality groups working to turn back decades of LGBTQ+ progress has been the American Principles Project (APP). APP and its chief underwriter Sam Fieler have invested millions of dollars in support of anti-LGBTQ+ candidates. In 2020, APP spent more than $2.6 million in ad spending in support of anti-equality candidates. In Virginia in 2021, APP spent at least $300,000 on digital advertising in support of Glenn Youngkin\u2019s gubernatorial campaign.\n\nRestoration PAC, run and funded by major anti-LGBTQ+ bankroller Dick Uihlein, spent at least $1.9 million in advertising across Virginia in support of Youngkin and donated $942,000 to the political arm of anti-abortion group Women Speak Out Virginia. Anti-equality group Free to Learn Action launched a $1 million ad campaign spreading widely debunked anti-transgender misinformation in support of Youngkin\u2019s campaign.\n\nMore than 150 major U.S. corporations have stood up and spoken out to oppose anti-transgender legislation being proposed in states across the country. Companies like Amazon, American Airlines, Apple, AT&T, AirBnB, Dell, Dow, Google, IBM, Lyft, Marriott, Microsoft, Nike, and Paypal have objected to these bills. Four of the largest U.S. food companies also condemned \u201cdangerous, discriminatory legislation that serves as an attack on LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly transgender and nonbinary people,\u201d and the Walton Family Foundation issued a statement expressing \u201calarm\u201d at the trend of anti-transgender legislation that recently became law in Arkansas.\n\nMany are rightly protective of the legacy of women\u2019s sports in this country, and a robust Title IX is central to that legacy. Importantly, advocates for women and girls in sports \u2013 such as the National Women\u2019s Law Center, the Women\u2019s Sports Foundation, Women Leaders in College Sports, and others \u2013 support trans-inclusive policies and oppose efforts to exclude transgender students from participating in sports. So do prominent female athletes including Billie Jean King, Megan Rapinoe, and Cheryl Reeve. That\u2019s because while there are real issues facing women\u2019s sports, including a lack of resources devoted to supporting them, transgender participation in athletics is not one of them.\n\nThe nation\u2019s leading child health and welfare groups representing more than 7 million youth-serving professionals and more than 1,000 child welfare organizations released an open letter calling for lawmakers in states across the country to oppose dozens of bills that target LGBTQ+ people, and transgender children in particular.\n\nNearly 550 college athletes have stood up to anti-transgender legislation by demanding the NCAA pull championships from states that have enacted anti-trans sports laws.\n\nTrans Equality Is Popular Across All Demographics\n\nThe reality is that however sensational and polarizing this issue may seem, public opinion polling across the country show strong support for trans-inclusive and pro-equality policies:\n\nRecent PRRI data shows a large majority of Americans (82%) favor laws that protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination in jobs, public accommodations, and housing, and majorities of Republicans (67%), independents (85%), and Democrats (92%) favor nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ+ Americans.\n\nA PBS/NPR/Marist poll states that 67% of Americans, including 66% of Republicans, oppose the anti-transgender sports ban legislation proliferating across 30 states.\n\nIn a 10-swing-state poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group in 2020 showed:\n\u2022 None At least 60% of Trump voters across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should be able to live freely and openly.\n\u2022 None At least 87% of respondents across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should have equal access to medical care, with many states breaking 90% support\n\u2022 None When respondents were asked about how they prioritized the importance of banning transgender people from participating in sports as compared to other policy issues, the issue came in dead last, with between 1% and 3% prioritizing the issue.\n\nAnother poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group revealed that, with respect to transgender youth participation in sports, the public\u2019s strong inclination is on the side of fairness and equality for transgender student athletes. 73% of voters agree that \u201csports are important in young people\u2019s lives. Young transgender people should be allowed opportunities to participate in a way that is safe and comfortable for them.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign is America\u2019s largest civil rights organization working to achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people.

A report by the HRC Foundation, \u201cAn Epidemic of Violence 2021,\u201d found that between 2013 and 2021, approximately two thirds of transgender and gender non-conforming people with known killers had their lives taken by an acquaintance, friend, family member or intimate partner. Intimate partners specifically accounted for over a fifth (21%) of all known perpetrators\u2013and it is likely this may even be an undercount. To date, the relationship of the victim to the killer is still unknown for a plurality (43%) of all identified cases of fatal violence.\n\nAdditionally, according to the 2015 United States Transgender Survey, 54% of transgender and non-binary people have experienced some form of intimate partner violence in their life. Last year, HRC released a report, titled \u201cLGBTQ Intimate Partner Violence and COVID-19,\u201d that details the increased risk of interpersonal violence faced by LGBTQ+ people, which is exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMore than 10,000 hate crimes in the U.S. involve a firearm each year, which equates to more than 28 each day, according to a 2020 report from HRC, Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, Giffords Law Center and Equality Florida titled \u201cRemembering and Honoring Pulse: Anti-LGBTQ Bias and Guns Are Taking Lives of Countless LGBTQ People.\u201d The report also notes a marked increase in anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes, especially against transgender people. According to the 2017-2019 Transgender Homicide Tracker, three-fourths of confirmed homicides against transgender people have involved a gun, and nearly eight in 10 homicides of Black trans women involve a gun. Further, advocates saw a 43% increase in the formation of anti-LGBTQ+ hate groups in 2019.\n\nAt the state level, transgender and gender non-conforming people in Texas are not explicitly protected from discrimination in employment, housing, education and public spaces. While Texas does include sexual orientation as a protected characteristic in its hate crimes law, it does not expressly include gender identity. While we have recently seen some political gains that support and affirm transgender people, we have also faced anti-LGBTQ attacks at many levels of government this year. As of this writing more than 200 anti-LGBTQ+ bills are under consideration in state legislatures across the country, more than 90 of which directly target transgender people.\n\nWe must demand better from our elected officials and reject harmful anti-transgender legislation at the local, state and federal levels, while also considering every possible way to make ending this violence a reality. It is clear that fatal violence disproportionately affects transgender women of color, especially Black transgender women. The intersections of racism, transphobia, sexism, biphobia and homophobia conspire to deprive them of necessities to live and thrive, so we must all work together to cultivate acceptance, reject hate and end stigma for everyone in the trans and gender non-conforming community.\n\nIn addition to the incidents of fatal violence that we track each year, HRC monitors several concerning deaths of transgender and gender non-conforming people where details are unclear. We call for further investigation into these cases, which currently stand at 14--seven of which occurred in 2021. You may find a list of these cases here.\n\nIn order to work towards this goal and combat stigma against transgender and non-binary people, HRC has collaborated with WarnerMedia on a PSA campaign to lift up their voices and stories. Learn more and watch the PSAs here.\n\nHRC has also launched the \u201cCount Me In\u201d campaign to encourage everyone, LGBTQ+ people and allies, to get loud, get visible and spread awareness on behalf of transgender and non-binary people. The more people who show they care, including allies and trans and non-binary people who speak up for the most marginalized in our community, the more hearts and minds we will change.

The House also passed House Bill 1005 today, a second anti-transgender bill that would prohibit transgender students from using multi-occupancy public school facilities consistent with their gender identity, including: shower rooms, bathrooms, changing rooms, and sleeping rooms for overnight trips. The bill now moves to the Senate.\n\nSenate Bill 46 was authored and submitted to the legislature by South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem. The hasty passage of this bill comes after a historically bad 2021 session that saw a record number of anti-transgender bills introduced and passed across the country. Last month, South Dakotans gathered for six concurrent rallies across the state in protest of this legislation and other anti-transgender bills introduced this year. In 2021, after issuing a style-and-form veto of an anti-trans sports ban bill, Noem issued two executive orders that effectively implemented the policy articulated in the vetoed legislation.\n\nIn a shocking exchange during the House State Affairs Committee\u2019s debate on SB 46 last week, the governor\u2019s Chief of Staff Mark Miller defended the bill by likening transgender kids to terrorists, saying \u201cBy putting it in law, we are ensuring that what we\u2019re seeing all over the country does not happen in South Dakota. It\u2019s sort of like terrorism, you want to keep it over there, not let it get to here.\" In this obscene statement, Miller unwittingly conceded what many proponents of the bill avoid mentioning, which is that legislators are unable to point to any instances of what they\u2019re legislating against \u2014 a theme across the country.\n\nHuman Rights Campaign State Legislative Director and Senior Counsel Cathryn Oakley issued the following statement in reaction to today\u2019s votes:\n\nCaught in the crosshairs of anti-LGBTQ+ elected officials\u2019 divisive political strategy are kids who are simply trying to navigate their adolescence \u2014 kids who face relentless targeting and increased levels of discrimination in their community, as evidenced by the record incidents of fatal violence against transgender and gender non-binary people in 2021.\n\nLegislators in a record 34 states introduced 147 anti-transgender bills in 2021, focusing on discriminatory anti-equality measures to drive a wedge between their constituents and score short-term political points. In 2021, legislators in twelve states enacted anti-LGBTQ+ bills despite failing to provide examples of what exactly they were legislating against.\n\nMerely introducing anti-transgender bills and peddling anti-transgender rhetoric has already had a damaging impact, leading to LGBTQ+ youth resources being surreptitiously removed from a government website, 11-year old kids literally having trouble sleeping, and a school district banning graphic novels with a transgender character after a parent's complaint. 2021 and 2020 were the deadliest and second deadliest years on record for trans & gender non-conforming people respectively, with the Human Rights Campaign tracking at least 50 violent deaths in 2021 alone. A new Trevor Project survey shows that a startling 85% of transgender or gender non-binary youth say their mental health has been negatively affected by these legislative attacks.\n\nAnti-transgender content on social media is also a radicalizing issue all by itself. This is in large part because transgender young people are among the most marginalized, voiceless, and defenseless communities in America, and because right-wing arguments play on long-standing misogynistic, racist, and sexist tropes about gender roles.\n\nThese bills are the result of a concerted effort by right-wing organizations that have been battling against LGBTQ+ progress for years. Across recent elections, one of the key anti-equality groups working to turn back decades of LGBTQ+ progress has been the American Principles Project (APP). APP and its chief underwriter Sam Fieler have invested millions of dollars in support of anti-LGBTQ+ candidates. In 2020, APP spent more than $2.6 million in ad spending in support of anti-equality candidates. In Virginia in 2021, APP spent at least $300,000 on digital advertising in support of Glenn Youngkin\u2019s gubernatorial campaign.\n\nRestoration PAC, run and funded by major anti-LGBTQ+ bankroller Dick Uihlein, spent at least $1.9 million in advertising across Virginia in support of Youngkin and donated $942,000 to the political arm of anti-abortion group Women Speak Out Virginia. Anti-equality group Free to Learn Action launched a $1 million ad campaign spreading widely debunked anti-transgender misinformation in support of Youngkin\u2019s campaign.\n\nMore than 150 major U.S. corporations have stood up and spoken out to oppose anti-transgender legislation being proposed in states across the country. Companies like Amazon, American Airlines, Apple, AT&T, AirBnB, Dell, Dow, Google, IBM, Lyft, Marriott, Microsoft, Nike, and Paypal have objected to these bills. Four of the largest U.S. food companies also condemned \u201cdangerous, discriminatory legislation that serves as an attack on LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly transgender and nonbinary people,\u201d and the Walton Family Foundation issued a statement expressing \u201calarm\u201d at the trend of anti-transgender legislation that recently became law in Arkansas.\n\nMany are rightly protective of the legacy of women\u2019s sports in this country, and a robust Title IX is central to that legacy. Importantly, advocates for women and girls in sports \u2013 such as the National Women\u2019s Law Center, the Women\u2019s Sports Foundation, Women Leaders in College Sports, and others \u2013 support trans-inclusive policies and oppose efforts to exclude transgender students from participating in sports. So do prominent female athletes including Billie Jean King, Megan Rapinoe, and Cheryl Reeve. That\u2019s because while there are real issues facing women\u2019s sports, including a lack of resources devoted to supporting them, transgender participation in athletics is not one of them.\n\nThe nation\u2019s leading child health and welfare groups representing more than 7 million youth-serving professionals and more than 1,000 child welfare organizations released an open letter calling for lawmakers in states across the country to oppose dozens of bills that target LGBTQ+ people, and transgender children in particular.\n\nNearly 550 college athletes have stood up to anti-transgender legislation by demanding the NCAA pull championships from states that have enacted anti-trans sports laws.\n\nTrans Equality Is Popular Across All Demographics\n\nThe reality is that however sensational and polarizing this issue may seem, public opinion polling across the country show strong support for trans-inclusive and pro-equality policies:\n\nRecent PRRI data shows a large majority of Americans (82%) favor laws that protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination in jobs, public accommodations, and housing, and majorities of Republicans (67%), independents (85%), and Democrats (92%) favor nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ+ Americans.\n\nA PBS/NPR/Marist poll states that 67% of Americans, including 66% of Republicans, oppose the anti-transgender sports ban legislation proliferating across 30 states.\n\nIn a 10-swing-state poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group in 2020 showed:\n\u2022 None At least 60% of Trump voters across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should be able to live freely and openly.\n\u2022 None At least 87% of respondents across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should have equal access to medical care, with many states breaking 90% support\n\u2022 None When respondents were asked about how they prioritized the importance of banning transgender people from participating in sports as compared to other policy issues, the issue came in dead last, with between 1% and 3% prioritizing the issue.\n\nAnother poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group revealed that, with respect to transgender youth participation in sports, the public\u2019s strong inclination is on the side of fairness and equality for transgender student athletes. 73% of voters agree that \u201csports are important in young people\u2019s lives. Young transgender people should be allowed opportunities to participate in a way that is safe and comfortable for them.\u201d", "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "",

To learn more, please read our Privacy Policy.\n\nWASHINGTON\u2014Today, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, the educational arm of the nation\u2019s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) civil rights organization, and the Equality Federation Institute released their 8th annual State Equality Index (SEI). The SEI is a comprehensive report that groups states into several broad categories regarding the type of advocacy that occurs there and details statewide laws and policies that affect LGBTQ+ people and their families. This year a record breaking 21 states and Washington, D.C. were recognized in the SEI for prioritizing innovative measures to advance LGBTQ+ equality, with Iowa, New Hampshire and Virginia joining those in the top category for the first time. These states have robust LGBTQ+ non-discrimination laws covering housing, healthcare and public accommodations. Although there has been incredible progress, by only March 2021, state legislatures across the country had filed more legislation that specifically targeted the transgender community than in modern history. In contrast, 2020 had previously held the record of the most anti-transgender legislation introduced, with 79 pieces of legislation\u20142021 had 147.\n\n\n\nThe 2021 State Equality Index outlines and analyzes how over a dozen states across the country led an intentional, coordinated attack on the transgender community, particularly children, across the country that has led to villainization, blatant discrimination, and ultimately, violence. On the other hand, we have seen a record-breaking amount of states step-up for LGBTQ+ equality and fight to pass laws that champion inclusivity and equity in the face of sweeping discrimination. It is clear that considerable effort has been, and continues to be made, to prevent anti-LGBTQ+ legislation from becoming law, progress toward LGBTQ+ equality in the states truly cannot be stopped.\" JoDee Winterhof, Human Rights Campaign Senior Vice President of Policy and Political Affairs\n\nIn 2021, anti-transgender legislation took several forms: 81 bills aimed to prevent transgender youth from playing school sports consistent with their gender identity, and 43 bills to prevent transgender youth from receiving gender-affirming healthcare. Additionally, two bathroom bills were passed in Tennessee and Arkansas passed the first-ever ban preventing transgender youth from accessing gender-affirming care. By the end of the 2021 legislative session, another record 13 bills attacking transgender youth passed into law. The SEI\u2019s assessment of statewide LGBTQ+-related legislation and policies in the areas of parenting laws and policies, religious refusal and relationship recognition laws, non-discrimination laws and policies, hate crime and criminal justice laws, youth-related laws and policies and health and safety laws and policies has placed each state in one of four distinct categories based on the type of advocacy that takes place there:\n\u2022 None Twenty-One states and the District of Columbia are in the highest-rated category, \u201cWorking Toward Innovative Equality\u201d: California; Colorado; Connecticut; Delaware; District of Columbia; Hawaii; Illinois; Iowa, Maine; Maryland; Massachusetts; Minnesota; Nevada; New Hampshire; New Jersey; New Mexico; New York; Oregon; Rhode Island; Vermont; Virginia and Washington.\n\u2022 None Three states are in the category \u201cSolidifying Equality\u201d: Alaska; Pennsylvania; and Utah.\n\u2022 None Four states are in the category \u201cBuilding Equality\u201d: Florida; Kansas; North Dakota; and Wisconsin. Twenty-Two states are in the lowest-rated category \u201cHigh Priority to Achieve Basic Equality\u201d: Alabama; Arizona; Arkansas; Georgia; Idaho; Indiana; Kentucky; Louisiana; Michigan; Mississippi; Missouri; Montana; Nebraska; North Carolina; Ohio; Oklahoma; South Carolina; South Dakota; Tennessee; Texas; West Virginia; and Wyoming.\n\nThis past year was one of the toughest in recent memory for our state partners and the LGBTQ+ community. Our opposition, after learning to refine their attacks by taking aim at particularly vulnerable communities like transgender youth, covered the country with anti-trans sports and medical care bans. Thanks to the work of advocates in the states, only a small percentage of these harmful bills were enacted. Despite difficult legislative sessions in many states, I am so proud of the work being done to make the lives of LGBTQ+ people better and more accepting no matter the community they call home.\u201d\n\nAlthough the transgender community received the brunt of discriminatory legislation, anti-LGBTQ+ bills took other forms as well, and one of the most notable trends was a resurgence of laws that carve all-new religious exemptions into existing laws that allows people to refuse to serve LGBTQ+ individuals. Across the country, 44 religious refusal bills were filed including about a dozen so-called Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) bills and a dozen more bills that would allow for religious refusals, including against LGBTQ+ patients, in medical care. South Dakota and Montana passed RFRA legislation and Ohio passed a medical care refusal bill. While this historically bad year has been the backdrop of the 2021 legislative session, 44 new pro-equality laws were also passed. The equality bills range in topic from ensuring that utility companies allow consumers to change their names and pronouns; to streamlining adoption requirements for stepparents; to ensuring that places of public accommodation have gender-neutral bathrooms; to make it easier to update birth and death certificates with correct names and gender markers. All ensure that LGBTQ+ people are able to take one step closer to full legal and lived equality.
