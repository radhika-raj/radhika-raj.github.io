This would allow transgender men who want children to avoid having to pause gender-affirming medical care and avoid vaginal probes, women\u2019s health clinics, and female-hormone-based treatments, all of which can be physically or emotionally distressing. Telfer discussed her findings, which have not yet been peer-reviewed, in a virtual presentation to the Society for Reproductive Investigation at its annual meeting, which was held in Denver, Colorado, last month. There are a handful of options for people who choose such treatment but want the option of having biological children someday. Adults can freeze their eggs, for instance. But this typically involves stopping testosterone treatment and allowing a menstrual cycle to return, which can take months. Hormone-based drugs are used to stimulate the ovaries to release multiple mature eggs, which are then collected in a surgical procedure that involves vaginal probes.

But the eggs did not look the same and Telfer\u2019s team will first try the technique on sheep before it uses human subjects.\n\n\u201cI would like to have our culture system be more robust before attempting fertilization,\u201d Telfer said.\n\nBut the LGBT community is excited.\n\n\u201cThe more options [to start a family] we have as trans people, the better,\u201d D.

In the fact-check, Miller herself provided PolitiFact with information from the Mayo Clinic, which \u201ccites the potential long-term effects of puberty blockers \u2014 including bone growth and density, future fertility and growth spurts.\u201d\n\nDespite the Mayo Clinic\u2019s findings, PolitiFact reported that \u201cnothing in the guidance [suggests] the effects of puberty blockers are irreversible, as Miller seems to contend.\u201d However, infertility, loss of bone density, and the under-development of sex organs (particularly for male minors taking puberty blockers) are, in fact, potentially irreversible side effects.\n\n\u201cYou cannot change your gender. It\u2019s a lie. And people who have gender identity problems, I sympathize with them, but why are we going to go along with \u2018The Emperor\u2019s New Clothes\u2019 and play along with this charade? I\u2019m not going to do it,\u201d Miller told Breitbart News Saturday host and Washington, DC, Bureau Chief Matthew Boyle. \u201cI mean they\u2019re purposely preventing the child\u2019s physical development, and I\u2019m calling it child abuse.\u201d\n\nMiller contended that giving children puberty blockers and indoctrinating them with the far-left transgender activist agenda is \u201cunpopular among Americans,\u201d and noted that \u201cAmericans don\u2019t want their role as a parent diminished.\u201d Recent polling from The Economist/YouGov found that a plurality of Americans do not believe parents should be able to provide their children, who claim to be transgender, with puberty-blocking drugs.\n\nOverall, Miller said she believes the transgender activist agenda has taken root because the United States has \u201crejected God\u201d and is \u201cswimming in an abyss of confusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am unashamed of our Judeo-Christian heritage and the values that most Americans hold to. God created us male and female \u2014 this is nothing but rebellion against God,\u201d she said.\n\nTo combat the infiltration of gender identity ideology in America\u2019s institutions, Miller said Americans must elect Republicans who will fight for the people they represent.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t just need Republicans who are going be placeholders and take the name \u2018Republican.\u2019 We don\u2019t need RINOs (Republican in name only). We need people that are going to fight,\u201d she said.\n\nThe congresswoman also encouraged Americans to stand up for their values in the face of opposition.\n\n\u201cWe need to quit scurrying to the corner. These people \u2014 their agenda is religious for them. Why are we ashamed of our Judeo-Christian heritage and our values? We need to be loud and proud about them. They are the values that bring freedom and productivity to a country, to its communities, and that cause our families to thrive,\u201d she said.\n\nBreitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://t.co/OhOlyZbxna", "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/03/18/poll-plurality-oppose-allowing-parents-to-give-children-puberty-blocking-drugs/", "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/09/fact-check-washington-post-reports-transgender-puberty-blockers-are-reversible/", "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/apr/17/mary-miller/rep-mary-miller-says-white-house-encouraging-kids-/", "https://twitter.com/RepMaryMiller/status/1512524288351510533?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/in-depth/pubertal-blockers/art-20459075"], "labels": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "puberty blockers", "weight": 0.08859128}, {"name": "Breitbart News Saturday host", "weight": 0.07935029}, {"name": "children", "weight": 0.07660209}, {"name": "child abuse", "weight": 0.07643667}, {"name": "Breitbart News", "weight": 0.074216045}, {"name": "puberty", "weight": 0.07149244}, {"name": "name", "weight": 0.070451275}, {"name": "Republican", "weight": 0.07005175}, {"name": "Mary Miller", "weight": 0.06398217}, {"name": "Rep.

Breitbart", "content": "\u201cThere is no more rabid advocate of transgenderism in America than the President of the United States,\u201d laments Catholic League president Bill Donohue Friday.\n\n\u201cIndeed, transgender mania has gripped the White House,\u201d Dr. Donohue writes, and the administration seems hell-bent on imposing its warped ideology on an unwilling nation.\n\n\u201cThere is no such person as a transgender \u2014 you are either male or female \u2014 but there is such a thing as transgenderism: it is an ideology that promotes the fiction that the sexes are interchangeable,\u201d Donohue asserts.\n\nThe White House \u201cis committed to encouraging the sexually confused to transition to the opposite sex, and that chemical castration and genital mutilation will follow,\u201d Donohue warns, citing White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki\u2019s declaration that the administration is convinced that gender-affirming health care \u201cis the best practice and potentially lifesaving,\u201d and includes puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and sex-reassignment surgery.\n\nPsaki also said the White House will go after states that resist their agenda.\n\nIn Friday\u2019s essay, Donohue cites Dr. Paul McHugh, the Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins Hospital and a noted expert in gender dysphoria, who has declared that

looks at transgender medical programs in Europe that had to be aborted because of their disastrous results.\n\nThe Amsterdam University Medical Center, for instance, surveyed 4,600 transgender men and

after practicing it for 22 years, when it found that these procedures are \u201cpotentially fraught with extensive and irreversible adverse consequences such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, infertility, increased cancer risk, and thrombosis.\u201d Denmark and France have followed suit.\n\nThe future will look back at today\u2019s transgender push and condemn it as the capitulation of

Rowling has compared the current climate of fear surrounding the discussion of transgender issues to the Soviet Union, quoting an anti-communist hero and leader of the Velvet Revolution.\n\n\u201cA spectre is haunting Eastern Europe: the spectre of what in the West is called dissent.\u201d\n\nThese words were penned by playwright and Czechoslovakian President V\u00e1clav Havel in his 1978 essay The Power of the Powerless to describe the brutal drive for conformity in all things enforced by the communist Soviet Union in his homeland, and elsewhere across the Soviet bloc.\n\nNow, it seems, Havel\u2019s words are being once again used by dissenters, but this time against the modern woke push for conformity in the ostensibly liberal West.\n\nIn a Twitter thread responding to a post declaring that the statement \u201ctrans women are women\u201d is being used to force biological women into bowing before the woke mob, author J.K. Rowling shared Havel\u2019s parable of a greengrocer who hung up the Marxist creed \u201cWorkers of the World Unite\u201d in his shop window in order to passively conform with the groupthink of the Soviet Union.\n\nQuoting from The Power of the Powerless, Rowling went on to post: \u201cIdeology is a specious way of relating to the world. It offers human beings the illusion of an identity, of dignity, and of morality while making it easier for them to part with them\u2026 it enables people to deceive their conscience and conceal their true position and their inglorious modus vivendi, both from the world and from themselves.\n\n\u201cIndividuals need not believe all these mystifications, but they must behave as though they did, or they must at least tolerate them in silence, or get along well with those who work with them. For this reason, however, they must live within a lie. They need not accept the lie. It is enough for them to have accepted their life with it and in it.\u201d\n\nThough Rowling was previously celebrated by the left for her unparalleled success as a female writer \u2014 and as a single mother on state handouts while writing her first novel \u2014 during her career, penning one of the most successful book series in history, she has run afoul of the woke mob over the past two years for questioning LGBT gender ideology.\n\nDespite still maintaining to be on the left politically, the Harry Potter author has expressed credulity over terms such as \u201cpeople who menstruate\u201d and has warned that biological women will lose some of their hard-won rights should transgenderism dismantle the idea of being a woman.\n\nFor this, Rowling has been branded as a \u201cTerf\u201d (trans-exclusionary radical feminist) and has been condemned by many whose careers she has helped build, including several Harry Potter actors and was whitewashed from a 20th-anniversary programme celebrating the films based on her book series.\n\nShe has also reported \u201cmany death threats\u201d after leftist activists doxxed her family address on social media late last year.\n\nEven still, it is worth noting that Rowling has not faced the same level of persecution that befell V\u00e1clav Havel under the yoke of the Soviet regime, at least for now.\n\nLess than one year after the publication of the essay, Havel was arrested by the regime and spent four years in prison for his thought crimes, for his \u201cdissent\u201d. The Power of the Powerless was not as easy for the Soviet state to imprison, and it would go on to become a chief rallying cry for the anti-communist movement throughout Eastern Europe.\n\nThe famed essay, his celebrated work as a playwright, and his steadfast refusal to cow to the regime saw Havel become a national hero of Czechoslovakia \u2014 a status which was further cemented during his role in 1989\u2019s Velvet Revolution (named after Lou Reed\u2019s Velvet Underground) in which over 40 years of communist rule in the country was brought to an end peacefully in part due to his leadership.\n\nV\u00e1clav Havel would go on to serve as the country\u2019s president until 1992 when the country was divided into two separate states, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.\n\nThough effectively ousted from frontline politics following the dissolution of the country, the revolutionary leader and playwright would continue to serve as a statesman and a moral arbiter of sorts, trying to spread the values of the Velvet Revolution throughout the world.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://hac.bard.edu/amor-mundi/the-power-of-the-powerless-vaclav-havel-2011-12-23", "https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1516793678265827333?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2022/03/07/jk-rowling-scottish-legislation-allowing-men-self-identify-women-will-put-people-danger/", "https://twitter.com/KurtZindulka", "https://t.co/rUbW9WDWBq", "https://twitter.com/BreitbartLondon/status/1502255516277514241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2021/11/22/j-k-rowling-receives-many-death-threats-after-home-doxed/", "https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1269382518362509313", "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2022/01/01/j-k-rowling-gets-few-seconds-of-screen-time-in-hbo-maxs-harry-potter-20th-anniversary-special/", "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/jk-rowling-people-defined-me-as-a-single-mother-on-benefits-and-assumed-i-wasn-t-fit-to-raise-my-child-8824498.html", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/04/GettyImages-164615320-1.jpg", "https://www.kcrw.com/music/articles/how-the-velvet-underground-influenced-the-velvet-revolution", "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/06/15/harry-potter-star-rupert-grint-turns-on-j-k-rowling-trans-women-are-women/", "https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1516793678265827333", "https://t.co/VbwqBtKbvQ"], "labels": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Soviet Union", "weight": 0.07197389}, {"name": "V\u00e1clav Havel", "weight": 0.071880236}, {"name": "biological women", "weight": 0.069806375}, {"name": "Velvet Revolution", "weight": 0.066722095}, {"name": "trans women", "weight": 0.06510735}, {"name": "Havel", "weight": 0.06460215}, {"name": "women", "weight": 0.06312231}, {"name": "Harry Potter author J.K.

We don\u2019t want this harm to come to you,\u201d she told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that [outreach] over people who agree with me on almost everything [politically] but are going to deny a full and healthy life to the next generation of kids like me,\u201d she added.\n\nThe transgender ideology insists that government should deny the importance of biology in shaping people\u2019s politics and personal lives.\n\nInstead, transgenderism asserts that government should champion each person\u2019s chosen sense of \u201cgender\u201d \u2014 which is defined as their sense of feeling male or female.\n\nThat focus on feelings \u2014 \u201cgender\u201d \u2014 instead of male-or-female biology gives men who claim to be transgender a moral right to claim bigotry \u2014 \u201cTransphobia!\u201d \u2014 when they feel rejected because lesbians do not want to sleep with them and their male genitalia.\n\nThe focus on feelings also gives status-seeking K-12 teachers a righteous excuse to groom an effeminate young boy or an insecure girl (who may or may not grow up to be gay or lesbian) towards a transgender identity, complete with a lifetime of sterilizing drugs, surgeries, loneliness, and poor health.\n\nThe transgender view also creates a lucrative opportunity for drug companies, doctors, and surgeons to feel virtuous about reshaping children\u2019s or teenagers\u2019 bodies to mimic the appearance of the opposite sex, regardless of the trauma and damage being done to children.\n\nThe transgender focus on feelings also pressures impressionable young journalists and accomplished adults to cheer for a \u201ctransgender\u201d man racing in a women\u2019s swimming competition, to ignore the multiplying hazards of transgender therapies and to refer to adult men in dresses as women.\n\nTransgenderism \u201cis an ideology that says whatever you think is true [about gender] becomes true,\u201d regardless of that biological reality, Terry Schilling, the president of the American Principles Project, told Breitbart News. But the reality and importance of biology are firmly recognized by many gays, lesbians, and conservatives, he said: \u201cUltimately, the common ground is that the LGB [lesbian, gay, and bisexual] part of the movement still believes in the concept of biological sex, and that is directly at odds with transgender ideology. \u2026 [But] the main divergent point is whether or not parents [or teachers] should be in charge of their kids\u2019 sexual education.\u201d\n\nSullivan\u2019s article spotlighted the common ground among gays, lesbians, and conservatives. For example, Sullivan also criticized the pro-transgender agitprop in K-12 classrooms:\n\nFor years, conservatives, feminists, and lesbians have been working together to oppose the aggressive transgender agenda. For example, the left-wing Women\u2019s Liberation Front group has worked with centrist, conservative, and religious groups to protect children and adults. On March 31, the groups touted draft legislation that \u201cclearly defines \u2018sex\u2019 based on biology (either male or female), seeks to enshrine into law common definitions of \u2018woman,\u2019 \u2018girl,\u2019 and \u2018mother,\u2019 and seeks to codify the intermediate scrutiny standard to allow the law to recognize sex when it is relevant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Family Research Council put out a report [in 2015] noting that a lot of these kids with gender identity issues were likely to grow up to be gay,\u201d Chart said. \u201cThe conclusion of their report was that these kids don\u2019t need to be sterilized. They\u2019re not in favor of sterilizing any of these kids, and on that issue, I\u2019d say we\u2019re a lot closer\u201d to conservatives than to transgender activists, she added.\n\n\u201cGays and lesbians can deal with Christian disagreements over same-sex marriage,\u201d Chart said, even as \u201cthe support of Christian conservatives for children who are same-sex attracted to grow up in healthy bodies is a lifeline.\u201d\n\nThe issue is getting some attention among left-wing intellectuals, including some who want to create a movement led by \u201ctrans moderates.\u201d\n\nPolls show the public is concerned about the child-protection issues, the forced entry of men into women\u2019s sports, and the transgender claims that each person\u2019s gender is more important than their sex.\n\nEven some transgender activists are alarmed. For example, an April 12 report in the Los Angeles Times profiled a psychologist who says he is a transgender woman and who is alarmed at the rising number of children who claim a transgender identity:\n\n\u201cThe first U.S. gender clinic dedicated to youth opened in Massachusetts in 2007. Today, there are more than 60,\u201d the paper reported.\n\nUnsurprisingly, ambitious Republican politicians are taking advantage of the Democrats\u2019 unconditional enthusiasm for the unpopular pro-transgender policies:\n\nBut the emerging alliance between conservatives, moderates, feminists, and sexual minorities could change the elites\u2019 support for transgenderism.\n\nSullivan is an immigrant from Britain, where a temporary alliance of conservatives, gays, and lesbians is beating the well-funded and very aggressive transgender movement.\n\nFor example, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has reversed pro-transgender policies in government agencies and healthcare centers, partly because of pressure from the feminist, gay, and lesbian groups who recognize the ideological threat posed by transgender men to their goals. The groups include the international LGB Alliance, and feminists\u2019 Respect My Sex campaign.\n\nTransgender activists have responded with many threats of violence. For example, one gay British anti-transgender protester was shoved by a transgender mob after he protested efforts by transgender groups to isolate and groom teenagers:\n\nThe British pushback against transgenderism is being aided by a new populist TV channel that debates issues that the establishment media prefer to ignore \u2014 and keeps asking British politicians to say if women have penises:\n\nBut in the United States, Democrat politicians are doubling down as they demand gays and lesbians ignore the poor economy and, instead, support the party\u2019s pro-transgender policies.\n\nTransgender activists are an extremely small share of the electorate \u2014 less than one percent \u2014 but they provide poor progressives with a moral incentive to vote for Democrats in the pending November midterm election.\n\n\u201cTo parents of transgender children, affirming your child\u2019s [claimed transgender] identity [is] one of the most powerful things you can do to keep them safe and healthy,\u201d President Joe Biden said in a March 31 video for the White House\u2019s \u201cTransgender Day of Visibility.\u201d He also encouraged more children and teenagers to get into the transgender van:\n\nIn Texas, \u201cpoliticians have sent state officials into the homes of loving parents to investigate them for abuse just to harass and intimidate the LGBTQI+ community,\u201d White House spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said on April 7 as she slammed state GOP legislators for curbing the transgender ide0logy in K-12 schools. She continued:\n\nThe transgender movement has won a stranglehold on the Democrat party. For example, many accomplished women \u2014 including journalists \u2014 have submitted to demands that they treat men wearing makeup as if they are fellow women:\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t work in Democratic [Party] politics anymore at all \u2014 even if you are a lesbian, gay or bisexual person \u2014 if you don\u2019t agree that sterilizing kids for gender identity is the best thing since sliced bread,\u201d Chart said, adding:\n\nThe quiet work of WoLF, Chart, Schilling, and many others on the left and right is paving the way for voters to make their views understood by risk-hating politicians, perhaps as soon as this November.\n\nTheir progress is marked by Sullivan\u2019s article, but also by other establishment journalists and editors who are willing to cautiously spotlight the dangers of the Democrats\u2019 transgender push.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 19, I had surgery for sex reassignment,\u201d said an April 11 op-ed, posted by Washington Post editors and written by a man who was likely homosexual before his surgery:\n\nI once believed that I would be more successful finding love as a woman than as a man, but in truth, few straight men are interested in having a physical relationship with a person who was born the same sex as them. In high school, when I experienced crushes on my male classmates, I believed that the only way those feelings could be requited was if I altered my body. It turned out that several of those crushes were also gay. If I had confessed my interest, what might have developed? Alas, the rampant homophobia in my school during the AIDS crisis smothered any such notions. Today, I have resigned myself to never finding a partner. That\u2019s tough to admit, but it\u2019s the healthiest thing I can do. \u2026\n\n What advice would I pass on to young people seeking transition? Learning to fit in your body is a common struggle. Fad diets, body-shaping clothing and cosmetic surgery are all signs that countless millions of people at some point have a hard time accepting their own reflection. The prospect of sex can be intimidating. But sex is essential in healthy relationships. Give it a chance before permanently altering your body.\n\n\u201cMost of all, slow down,\u201d the author said. \u201cYou may yet decide to make the change.

That legislation must go to the state House for further consideration.\n\nBesides signing the transgender athletes ban last year, Gov. Lee has signed a few other pieces of legislation that protect women and young children from the transgender activist agenda. In May of 2021, Lee signed a bill into law that separates private spaces such as bathrooms and locker rooms for use by individuals according to their birth sex.

Eric Holcomb\u2019s (R) decision to veto a transgender sports ban bill, a move which \u201cwill begin the big sort-out of who will be running for governor and U.S. Senate in 2024,\u201d a Herald Bulletin political columnist observed Monday.\n\nRoughly 53 percent of Indiana voters strongly disapprove (42.1 percent) or somewhat disapprove (11 percent) of Holcomb\u2019s decision to veto a bill that would ban boys who think they are girls from competing on girls\u2019 K-12 sports teams, a Spry Strategies Indiana General Election poll found. The weighted poll was conducted from March 28- April 3 among 1,012 likely 2022 voters and has a margin of error of \u00b13.1 percentage points.\n\nOnly 28.1 percent of those polled \u201cstrongly approve\u201d of Holcomb\u2019s veto, and 11.3 percent somewhat approve. Seven percent are unsure or have no opinion on the matter.\n\nHolcomb angered conservatives in late March when he vetoed HEA 1041, legislation designed to protect women\u2019s sports from transgender activism. Holcomb said in a letter to legislators that he found \u201cno evidence\u201d to support the idea that sports are suffering from a lack of fairness in his state.\n\n\u201cThe wide-open nature of the grievance provisions in HEA 1041 that apply to all K-12 schools in Indiana makes it unclear about how consistency and fairness will be maintained for parents and students across different counties and school districts,\u201d Holcomb wrote in the letter.\n\n\u201cThe presumption of the policy laid out in HEA 1041 is that there is an existing problem in K-12 sports in Indiana that requires further state government intervention,\u201d he added. \u201cIt implies that the goals of consistency and fairness in competitive female sports are not currently being met. After a thorough review, I find no evidence to support either claim even if I support the overall goal.\u201d\n\nHolcomb vetoed the bill even though Indiana voters overwhelmingly oppose boys who identify as girls from playing in girls\u2019 sports. More than 60 percent of voters strongly support or somewhat support banning males who identify as females from playing in girl\u2019s sports in both K-12 schools and college, the poll found.\n\nAccording to the Herald Bulletin, the General Assembly\u2019s supermajority Republican caucuses are \u201cexpected to easily override that veto\u201d on May 24 during technical corrections.\n\n\u201cBut the more telling day on where the GOP stands could be June 18 at the Indiana Farmers Coliseum in Indianapolis when the Indiana Republican Party convenes,\u201d columnist Brian Howey wrote.\n\nIn addition to his transgender veto, Holcomb has taken GOP hits on the way he conducted the pandemic shutdowns in 2020. Holcomb won reelection in landslide fashion in November 2020, so he\u2019s on stable ground with most voters, but not with the GOP\u2019s socially conservative wing. So when Hoosier Republicans gather at the Indiana State Fairgrounds in June, it will be about much more than November\u2019s midterm elections. The coming veto override will still be fresh in the minds of many delegates. It will begin the big sort-out of who will be running for governor and U.S. Senate in 2024.\n\nHolcomb has a decent approval rating for now, according to the survey. Out of 1,012 voters, 36.7 percent say they \u201csomewhat approve\u201d of \u201cthe job Eric Holcomb is doing as Governor for the state of Indiana,\u201d and 19 percent \u201cstrongly approve.\u201d Nearly 22 percent \u201csomewhat disapprove\u201d and 17.7 percent strongly disapprove.\n\nKatherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News.

Kay Ivey (R-AL) signed two bills passed by the Alabama Legislature into law related to the transgender issue.\n\nOne bill, deemed the Alabama Vulnerable Child Protection Act (SB184), prohibited the prescription of transgender conversion therapies for minors. The other piece of legislation, HB322, implements a restriction on discussions of sexual orientation at the K-5 grade-school level in Alabama public schools and institutes a biological sex bathroom requirement.\n\nThose bills drew the ire of White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who spoke out against them during her press briefing a day earlier.\n\n\u201cToday in Alabama, instead of focusing on critical kitchen table issues like the economy, COVID, or addressing the country\u2019s mental health crisis, Republican lawmakers are currently debating legislation that, among many things, would target trans youth with tactics that threaten to put pediatricians in prison if they provide medically necessary lifesaving health care for the kids they serve,\u201d Psaki said. \u201cJust like the extreme government overreach we\u2019ve seen in Texas, where politicians have sent state officials into the homes of loving parents to investigate them for abuse just to harass and intimidate the LGBTQI+ community, today\u2019s vote in Alabama will only serve to harm kids. But Alabama\u2019s lawmakers and other legislators who are contemplating these discriminatory bills have been put on notice by the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services that laws and policies preventing care that health care professionals recommend for transgender minors may violate the Constitution and federal law.\u201d\n\nIn comments given exclusively to Breitbart News late Friday, Ivey rejected Psaki\u2019s statement and declared her state was \u201cprepared to defend our values.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlabama will continue protecting our kids and not letting out-of-state liberals like Jen Psaki and the Biden White House tell us what to do,\u201d Ivey said. \u201cOur state is prepared to defend our values. Like I said, we need to focus on properly developing our children into the adults God intended them to be.\u201d\n\nDespite Alabama\u2019s in-state media coverage, which is decidedly against both bills that received overwhelming approval in the Republican-dominated Alabama Legislature, Ivey is not alone in her defiance against the Biden White House.\n\nAlabama State Reps.

She said transgenderism was not a \u201ckitchen table\u201d issue.\n\nPsaki opened her remarks by criticizing a bill in the Alabama state legislature that bans life-altering drug treatment or surgery to transgender minors. It is similar to legislation in other states and does not affect the medical choices of transgender adults.\n\nAcross the country, as we\u2019ve talked about a bit in here, Republican elected officials are engaging in a disturbing, cynical trend of attacking vulnerable transgender kids for purely partisan political reasons. Today, in Alabama, instead of focusing on critical kitchen table issues like the economy, COVID, or addressing the country\u2019s mental health crisis, Republican lawmakers are currently debating legislation that, among many things, would target transgender youths with tactics that threatens to put pediatricians in prison if they provide medically-necessary, life-saving health care for the kids they serve. Just like the extreme government overreach we\u2019ve seen in Texas, where politicians have sent state officials into the homes of loving parents to investigate them for abuse just to harass and intimidate the LGBTQI+ community, today\u2019s vote in Alabama will only serve to harm kids. Alabama\u2019s lawmakers and other legislators who are contemplating these discriminatory bills have been put on notice by the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services that laws and policies preventing care that health care professionals recommend for transgender minors may violate the Constitution and federal law. To be clear, every major medical association agrees that gender-affirming health care for transgender kids is a best practice and potentially life-saving. All of this begs an important question: what are these policies actually trying to solve for? LGBTQI+ people can\u2019t be erased or forced back into any closets, and kids across the nation should be allowed to be who they are, without the threat that their parents or their doctor could be imprisoned simply for helping them and loving them. President Biden has committed in both words and actions to fight for all Americans and will not hesitate to hold these states accountable.\n\nPsaki did not say how old a child had to be before deciding he or she was transgender, or how old he or she had to be before qualifying for drugs or surgery to reassign or \u201caffirm\u201d their gender, or whether parents should have to consent beforehand.\n\nThe recent book Irreversible Damage by Abigail Shrier documents how many schools and doctors are providing drugs and mastectomies to minor girls who have decided they are transgender men, often without the informed consent of parents.\n\nContrary to Psaki\u2019s claim that \u201cpartisan politics\u201d is the only motivation behind laws such as the Alabama bill, most bills appear to be motivated by concern for the safety of children. Recent polls suggest parents of both parties are concerned about teaching young children about sexuality and gender, and bipartisan majorities support laws to restrict such instruction.\n\nPsaki also celebrated the Senate\u2019s confirmation of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nJoel B.

Spencer Cox was caught on camera telling middle and high school students his \u201cpreferred pronouns\u201d \u2014 a concept created by transgender activists to help convince people they can choose the sex they \u201cidentify\u201d with.\n\nCox identified himself as \u201che, him, and his\u201d after a student who called herself a \u201cbisexual woman\u201d listed her pronouns and asked the governor about mental health resources for youth who believe they are gay or lesbians, during an April 13, 2021 virtual #OneUtah Student Town Hall. Twitter user Adam Bartholomew broadcast the video after he posted a shortened compilation of the town hall on Tuesday. The post received more than 1,000 likes and hundreds of comments from other users, including political figures and commentators.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I would call it buyer\u2019s remorse, but there\u2019s a lot of people who are having heartburn because this is not what they signed up for,\u201d Utah Republican Party Carson Jorgensen said in response during an exclusive interview with Breitbart News on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThank you so much Gabby for that question. And my preferred pronouns are he, him, and his. So thank you for sharing yours with me,\u201d Cox said in the town hall. Cox addressed \u201cmask mandates, sex education, gun violence, and more,\u201d according to the description of the virtual event.\n\nThe shortened clip also includes a portion of the town hall showing Cox talking about \u201cequity and inclusion,\u201d buzzwords based on the teachings of Critical Race Theory (CRT).\n\n\u201cLeading with equity and inclusion starts at a young age, and the students that are joining us today have shown great leadership through their academic achievement and civic participation in our state,\u201d Cox said.\n\nBreitbart News reached out to Cox\u2019s office for comment and also asked if the governor routinely shares his \u201cpreferred pronouns\u201d and if he believes sharing them with students is appropriate. His office did not respond by the time of publication.\n\nJorgensen said Cox catering to the far-left agenda goes \u201cabsolutely against everything we believe in.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, the governor is out of step with what people in the state and especially Republicans in the state really feel,\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cAs a state party, we want to support him, but this is not something we can support. And this is not something the majority of Republicans and the majority of people \u2014 not just Republicans here in the state \u2014 are in for.\u201d\n\nJorgensen said Cox\u2019s behavior in the the town hall seems to be part of a greater emerging pattern. Cox recently vetoed a GOP-led measure that would ban males from playing in female sports, saying he tries to \u201cerr of the side of compassion.\u201d However, the state legislature had enough votes to override Cox\u2019s veto.\n\nBefore and after his election, Cox has been rather vocal in his support for the LGBTQ+ community, according to Desert News. In June 2021, the Republican governor even designated the month of June as LGBTQ+ Pride Month \u2014 \u201cthe first such statewide designation in Utah\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nCox sat down with Desert News for a Q & A about LBGTQ+ Pride, and said he has \u201cbeen attacked for pushing an agenda of kindness and inclusion.\u201d The reporter asked Cox if he has faced backlash within his own party for his stance on LGBTQ+ issues, to which he said \u201cI certainly have.\u201d\n\nHe said in part:\n\nI think from a very base, practical, political standpoint, I think that it\u2019s critical to the survival of the party. I think there\u2019s a younger generation for sure \u2014 my own kids are good examples of this \u2014 that see the world very differently, and I can\u2019t imagine why anyone would be hostile toward this segment of our society. But more importantly, as a Republican, this is who we are. I believe that the conservative movement is about empowering individuals and helping everyone to be successful, regardless of their backgrounds or beliefs or their sexual orientation. And so I actually think it\u2019s very firmly with the party of Lincoln, that we would be the party that seeks to help others to lift those, especially those that are the most marginalized, and those that are struggling, to give them the same opportunities as everyone else.\n\nJorgensen pointed Breitbart News to a 2021 2KUTV report in which Cox said he wanted to change how state school board members are elected. Utah notably went to a partisan system in 2020, meaning state school board members must identify with a political party. Then, Utahns vote for who best represents them.\n\nBut according to the outlet, Cox believed his inability to be able to appoint board members \u201ctakes accountability away from his office.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery governor runs to be the \u2018education governor,\u2019 to work on education issues,\u201d Cox said. \u201cThe truth is the governor (of Utah) probably has less direct impact on K-12 education than any governor in the nation.\u201d\n\nJorgensen said Cox\u2019s desire to be more involved with the state\u2019s education, combined with his use of preferred pronouns and continued deference to the transgender agenda \u201chas a lot of people on edge.\u201d He said:\n\nThe chairman added that the influence of the Mormon church (the Church of the Latter Day Saints) is \u201csuch a predominant figure in the state,\u201d and has been \u201cvery clear on their stance on gender and marriage.\u201d The Church of the Latter Day Saints\u2019 website indeed lists its position on \u201cgender\u201d and sexuality:\n\nWhile the governor has done some good things like signing the state\u2019s constitutional carry bill, Jorgenson said, social issues are \u201cwhere the rubber meets the road.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe social issues are the ones that have these people fired up, and he just continues to double down on them.\u201d\n\nKatherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News.

Critical Race Theory (CRT).\n\n\u201cLeading with equity and inclusion starts at a young age, and the students that are joining us today have shown great leadership through their academic achievement

and if he believes sharing them with students is appropriate. \n\nJorgensen pointed Breitbart News to a 2021 2KUTV report in which Cox said he wanted to change how state school board members are elected. \n\nBut according to the outlet, Cox believed his inability to be able to appoint board members \u201ctakes accountability away from his office.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery governor runs to be the

UK has described the process of becoming transgender as a \u2018sacred journey\u2019 in a letter urging the nation\u2019s government to ban trans \u2018conversion therapy\u2019.\n\nOne UK Bishop has demanded that the UK government implements a ban on trans \u201cconversion therapy\u201d, describing the process in which people become transgender as a \u201csacred journey\u201d.\n\nThe clergyman\u2019s comments come as Britain moves to ban so-called \u201cconversion therapy\u201d for homosexuals, though those who identify as \u201ctransgender\u201d will not be covered by the proposed legislation.\n\nMany are not happy about this exclusion however, with a number of activists expressing outrage over the government\u2019s decision, despite attempts by the UK Conservative Party to appease the country\u2019s LGBT lobby.\n\nOne of those unhappy with the exclusion is Rowan Williams, an Anglican Bishop who previously served as the Archbishop of Canterbury, considered to be the most senior clerical role in the Anglican church.\n\nWilliams has since written a letter to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging him to implement a ban on trans conversion therapy.\n\n\u201cConversion to Christianity is the event or process by which a person responds joyfully to the glorious embrace of the eternally loving and ever-merciful God,\u201d The Telegraph reports Williams as writing in the letter, which is also signed by a number of other Anglican bishops.\n\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with so-called \u2018conversion therapy\u2019 \u2013 pressure put by one person on another to fit their expectations; the attempt to induce vulnerable and isolated people to deny who they truly are,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cTo be trans is to enter a sacred journey of becoming whole: precious, honoured and loved, by yourself, by others and by God,\u201d the former senior cleric also wrote.\n\nBritain\u2019s incoming ban on so-called \u201cconversion therapy\u201d has prompted significant fears regarding the right to free speech in the country, with many religious people fearing that the law will curb their ability to pray.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be illegal for Christians to teach their faith, or for people to pray for their friends,\u201d argued the Christian Institute regarding the ban. \u201cBut that\u2019s clearly what the campaigners want.\u201d\n\nThis claim by the Christian think-tank does not appear to be all that farfetched, with some close to the halls of power in the UK seemingly thinking that the banning of non-coercive Christian prayer would not be a potential design flaw of the legislation, but a feature, with one former member of the UK\u2019s LGBT+ advisory panel demanding such prayer be banned for resembling hate speech.\n\n\u201cAll prayer that seeks to change or suppress someone\u2019s innate sexuality or gender identity is deeply damaging and causes immeasurable harm,\u201d former government advisor, Jayne Ozanne, claimed.\n\n\u201cPrayer isn\u2019t prayer if it causes you to hate yourself for being LGBT!\u201d she also claimed. \u201cIt\u2019s actually \u2018Hate

Breitbart", "content": "President Joe Biden\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to overrule a lower court order that prohibits mandated transgender care for health insurance providers.\n\nJudge Reed O\u2019Connor for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas issued an injunction in 2021 that prevented HHS from interpreting the Affordable Care Act\u2019s anti-discrimination to require a health care provider involved in the legal dispute to provide health insurance for gender-transitioning procedures or abortion care.\n\nHere, the RFRA violation, the success on the merits, is all but conceded. No party disputes that the current Section 1557 regulatory scheme threatens to burden Christian Plaintiffs\u2019 religious exercise in the same way as the 2016 scheme: namely, by placing substantial pressure on Christian Plaintiffs, in the form of fines and civil liability, to perform and provide insurance coverage for gender-transition procedures and abortions\u2026 The ACLU and the government narrowly read Plaintiffs\u2019 live pleading as challenging just the 2016 Rule and not Section 1557 itself; thus, limiting the possible scope of injunctive relief to the 2016 Rule. See Ints.\u2019 Supp. Resp. 12, ECF No. 201. But Rule 54(c) provides no such limit.\n\nHHS argued O\u2019Connor\u2019s order is moot because the agency rescinded and replaced a 2016 rule the lawsuit stems from. That 2016 HHS rule, which O\u2019Connor largely vacated, said the Affordable Care Act\u2019s prohibition on sex-based discrimination included gender identity, transgender status, or termination of a pregnancy.\n\nBut O\u2019Connor nevertheless issued a 2021 order that blocks HHS from taking future action against the providers based on rules or interpretations having the same effect as the 2016 rule, HHS said. That order was improper, the agency said. Providers can\u2019t \u201creanimate\u201d the case by claiming that their fight against the 2016 rule implicitly included a challenge against future enforcement of Section 1557 itself, HHS said. The providers never asserted that the law, as applied in the transgender care context, would violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, it said.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union joined the case and urged the Fifth Circuit to overturn O\u2019Connor\u2019s injunction against the HHS rule.\n\nThe case is Franciscan Alliance v.

First, the White House noted its involvement in Brandt v. Rutledge, a case challenging an Arkansas law that would prevent health care providers from giving children under 18 \u201cgender-affirming health care.\u201d\n\nSecond, the White House highlighted the DOJ\u2019s participation in B.P.J. v. West Virginia State Board of Education, a lawsuit seeking to overturn West Virginia\u2019s ban on transgender athletes participating in women\u2019s sports. \u201cThe United States has a significant interest in ensuring that all students, including students who are transgender, can participate in an educational environment free of unlawful discrimination,\u201d the DOJ wrote in its statement of interest.\n\nThird, the White House applauded the DOJ\u2019s involvement in Corbitt v. Taylor, where the DOJ filed an amicus curiae brief. This lawsuit challenged an Alabama law that allows transgender citizens to change their gender marker on a driver\u2019s license only if they have had gender-transitioning surgery. The DOJ argued that Alabama law violated the 14th Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause because it \u201csingles out transgender persons for differential treatment and causes them affirmative harm.\u201d\n\nFinally, the White House noted the DOJ\u2019s amicus brief filed in Adams v. School Board of St. John\u2019s County, which involved a Florida school preventing a transgender child from using the boys\u2019 restroom. The DOJ argued that the school\u2019s policy violated Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause. The DOJ ignored potential privacy issues stemming from a girl using the boys\u2019 restroom because \u201cif the School Board were to find any student\u2014transgender or cisgender\u2014 behaving inappropriately in a restroom, the school can and should address such behavior.\u201d\n\nIn addition to highlighting the transgender activism Biden\u2019s DOJ is doing in the judiciary, Biden also announced a slew of actions \u201cto support the mental health of transgender children,\u201d among other things.\n\n\u201cTransgender people are some of the bravest people in our nation. But nobody should have to be brave just to be themselves,\u201d the White House wrote in its announcement.\n\nSome of the moves include the State Department and Department of Homeland Security changing the travel process to accommodate transgender and nonbinary individuals. Starting in April, U.S. citizens will be allowed to make \u201cx\u201d on their passport applications, as opposed to \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration will also allow individuals to receive social security to update their gender information with the Social Security Administration without providing a doctor\u2019s note as proof of identity.\n\nAdditionally, the White House will use taxpayer dollars to study the impact gender-affirming health care has on children\u2019s mental health.\n\nThe cases are Brandt v.

on sports teams that match their birth sex, a new Public Opinion Strategies poll found.\n\nOut of 1000 registered voters surveyed nationally on March 25-28, 60 percent say they believe transgender athletes should only be allowed to play on teams that match biological reality. The margin of error is \u00b1 3.53 percentage points. Broken down by political affiliation, Republicans agree that transgender athletes should only play on the team that aligns with their birth sex 85 percent to 7 percent, and independents agree 60 percent to 23 percent. Unsurprisingly, Democrats \u201caren\u2019t as sure,\u201d with 39 percent in agreement and 36 percent in opposition.\n\nThe poll results come amid a rather contentious public debate \u2014 mostly between Republicans and far-left Democrats and activists \u2014 about what constitutes \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d and whether men who identify as women have an advantage over actual women in athletics. The debate has been spurred on by real-life manifestations of leftist \u201cgender identity\u201d ideology, a prime example being male University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas, who has taken titles from actual women because of his biological advantage.\n\nWhile Democrats have been willing to let go of some other unpopular policy positions to save themselves at the polls, many in the party have not yet reconciled with the reality that voters largely reject the force-feeding of transgender ideology.\n\nIn contrast, at least a dozen GOP-states so far have proposed or passed laws that ban men and boys who identify as women in girls from playing on women\u2019s sports teams in schools and colleges. Ultimately, the ability to define a basic objective truth is already impacting the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nSurveys and polls show that activists\u2019 push to coerce voters into not believing their own eyes is fueling public support for a clear, biology-based definition of women. For example, Democrats have enjoyed a multi-decade trust advantage on education issues. But a March 23 poll showed that \u201cForty-three percent (43%) of voters trust Republicans more to deal with education issues while 36% trust Democrats more.\u201d The poll of 1,000 likely voters was conducted on March 17-20 by Rasmussen Reports.\n\nKatherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News.

Kentucky passed bills that would ban transgenders from participating in women's sports.", "content": "Arizona, Oklahoma, and Kentucky on Thursday joined the ranks of other states whose Republican-led legislatures have passed bills to protect girls\u2019 sports from transgender activists.\n\nThe states join Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, and Iowa, among others, as well as Utah, whose GOP-dominated legislature voted to override the governor\u2019s veto on Friday. All three state legislatures have passed the bills on to their governors for approval (or possible veto) in the coming days.\n\nThe GOP-dominated Arizona House voted 31/24 to send SB 1165 to Gov. Doug Ducey\u2019s (R) desk. According to the Associated Press, Ducey has not said whether he will sign the bill \u2014 the publication pointed to both Utah\u2019s governor and Indiana\u2019s, who in recent days vetoed similar bills in their states. (However, the Utah legislature voted to override Gov. Spencer Cox\u2019s veto, and the Indiana State Legislature says it plans to do the same in May.)\n\nArizona\u2019s ban would apply to both public schools and colleges, as well as private institutions that compete against public schools. The bill does specify that men and women can compete together in \u201ccoed\u201d or \u201cmixed\u201d events and does not restrict women from playing on teams designated for men.\n\nThe bill lists several studies confirming the biological differences of men and women, and boys and girls, including the physiological advantages boys as young as six years old have in athletics, such as \u201ccardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and speed/agility\u2026\u201d The bill also details how testosterone in men gives them a greater advantage over women, even after a year of testosterone suppression, which the Internal Olympics Committee requires for \u201ctransgender women\u201d participants.\n\nUnder the legislation, any student who is \u201cdeprived of an athletic opportunity or suffers any direct or indirect harm as a result of a school knowingly violating\u201d the bill has the right to sue the school for damages. The bill also prohibits schools, athletic associations, and organizations from retaliating against any student who reports a school violation, and it allows the student to sue any of those aforementioned entities if they do retaliate.\n\nAdditionally, a school is allowed to sue government entities, athletic organizations and associations, and accrediting organizations, if it suffers damage because of a violation of the bill.\n\nThe Arizona House on Thursday also approved a bill that would ban irreversible gender-reassignment surgeries for minors.\n\nOklahoma\u2019s SB2 passed along party lines 37-7 and awaits a signature from Gov. Kevin Stitt (R), who has only a few days to decide whether to veto or pass the bill.\n\nThe legislation is almost identical to Arizona\u2019s bill, mandating that \u201cteams designated for \u2018females,\u2019 \u2018women,\u2019 or \u2018girls\u2019 shall not be open to students of the male sex,\u201d and allowing for students to sue a school if it violates the legislation and deprives that student of an athletic opportunity.\n\nThe bill differs in that it orders the parents or legal guardians of a student at the beginning of each school year to \u201csign an affidavit acknowledging the biological sex of the student at birth.\u201d\n\nWhile media reports have not confirmed whether Gov. Stitt has vocalized his support of the bill, Stitt has a history of favoring legislation rooted in biological reality. Stitt previously said \u201cthere is no such thing as non-binary sex,\u201d and once issued an executive order telling the Oklahoma State Department of Health that \u201cchanges in sex or gender on a birth certificate or a designation of nonbinary\u201d is \u201ccontrary\u201d to state law, a local ABC News affiliate reported.\n\nKentucky lawmakers passed SB83 26-9, which bans men who think they are women from participating in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports from sixth grade through college.\n\nThe legislation would require students to have an original, unedited copy of their birth certificate or a signed affidavit from a medical practitioner. However, the bill does not restrict who can participate in coed or boys\u2019 or men\u2019s teams.\n\nWhile the law does not contain language that would give students the green light to sue their school for damages if it breaks the law, it mandates that governments, licensing or accrediting organizations, and athletic associations are barred from taking adverse action or opening investigations.\n\nAccording to the Courier Journal, Democrat Gov. Andy Beshear has not indicated whether he will pass or veto the bill. The publication did note that the state legislature\u2019s Republican supermajorities \u201chave the power to override it.\u201d\n\nKatherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News.

She said:\n\nThe two groups may be politically influential \u2013 especially because the Democrats need every vote they can get in the increasingly polarized 2022 election. Stelzer\u2019s group has forged alliances with many groups on both sides of the political divide. Hogshead-Makar\u2019s group has won large-scale support from the U.S. swimming sector.\n\nIn many prior debates, voter rebukes have been used by party leaders to squash unpopular and damaging demands by party activists.\n\nThe GOP, for example, regained power in 2016 by quietly burying opposition to Obamacare from wealthy business interests. GOP voters have also killed the GOP\u2019s business-first support for free trade and labor migration since 2016.\n\nSimilarly, the Democratic leaders boosted their votes from swing districts by suppressing demands by urban party activists for gun control after their presidential candidate, Al Gore, lost his home state in 2000.\n\nThis year, Democrats have abandoned progressive demands for defunding police forces and anti-epidemic masks. Also, New York\u2019s Democratic leaders are reversing their prior support for unpopular laws that allow the easy release of suspected criminals before trials.\n\nBut despite the political danger signs in 2022, Democratic leaders have not yet challenged the progressives\u2019 growing hostility to single-sex sports.\n\nMany progressives have cheered as activists claimed sports is about personal liberation, not fairness: portrayed opposition to cross-sex athletes as akin to racism, insisted that young children be trained in transgender claims, declared their inability to define women, and organized high-pressure re-education campaigns on teachers to embrace the ideology.\n\nSurveys and polls show that the activists\u2019 fervent support for transgenderism is fueling public support for a clear, biology-based definition of women. For example, Democrats have enjoyed a multi-decade trust advantage on education issues. But a March 23 poll showed that \u201cForty-three percent (43%) of voters trust Republicans more to deal with education issues while 36% trust Democrats more.\u201d The poll of 1,000 likely voters was conducted on March 17-20 by Rasmussen Reports.\n\nAmid the transgender advocacy, GOP candidates are now beating Democrats by an average of 3 points in the RealClearPolitics\u2018 average of \u201cGeneric Congressional Vote\u201d polls. In 2020, the GOP almost won a House majority even though the Democrats had a three-point advantage.\n\nIn the GOP, most legislators are zig-zagging between the business-first Republicans who prefer to avoid a fight with Democrats over transgenderism and the GOP\u2019s base of voters who are alarmed at the top-down cultural changes that make it harder for them to manage their families and communities.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s voters are winning the debate against the business-first Republicans, partly because the sports issue is particularly important outside the major cities because many GOP-leaning suburban parents want to help their daughters and sons participate in sports. In Virginia, those voters helped an establishment GOP candidate win a come-from-behind race for the Virginia governor\u2019s office.\n\nThe injection of men into womens\u2019 sports is \u201cunfair,\u201d the GOP\u2019s House leader, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (RCA), told Breitbart News on March 23.\n\n\u201cFacts are facts, the earth is round, the sun is hot, there are two genders \u2026 To say otherwise is to deny science,\u201d said the campaign document released February 22 by Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL), who is the 2022 chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. In exchange for Americans\u2019 votes, Scott\u2019s document promises to protect the government\u2019s recognition of the two different-and-complementary sexes:\n\nRepublican staffers are also using the transgender issue to undermine President Joe Biden\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court:\n\nRepublican legislators in the House and the Senate have introduced bills to protect sports from the transgender ideology. No Democrats have co-sponsored the bills.\n\nAlso, the GOP\u2019s establishment members are backing away from prior support for transgenderism. On January 9, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) ended her support for the pro-transgender Fairness for All Act bill. Reps. Claudia Tenney (R-NY) and Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ), also withdrew their support for the bill which would make \u201cgender identity\u201d a judicially-enforced civil right against Americans\u2019 single-sex associations, institutions, and community groups.\n\nBreitbart News has closely tracked the expanding partisan divide as progressives pull the Democratic Party towards the transgender ideology and as conservatives increasingly champion the reality of the two sexes. A March survey from The Economist/YouGov found:\n\nAdvocates for transgenderism quietly admit they have failed to persuade the public. \u201cRight now, our opposition wins the debate on trans youth in sports against any and all arguments we have tried for our side,\u201d admitted a recent \u201cMessaging Guide\u201d by the Transgender Law Center in California.\n\nBut the activists are trying to sideline the public opposition, for example, by denying the existence of the sex-versus-gender dispute in sports:\n\nProgressives are also trying to portray the opposition as bigoted hostility to gays. In Florida, for example, Democrats are denouncing a bill they label as \u201cThe Don\u2019t Say Gay Bill,\u201d even though it only bars gender-and-sex training for kids below fifth grade. Yet Democratic voters are still backing the Florida child protection bill, according to two polls.", "medium": "Article", "links":

corporate media appear to be determined to spread fake news about Florida's Parental Rights in Education Bill.", "content": "Leftist activists and members of the corporate media appear to be determined to spread fake news about Florida\u2019s Parental Rights in Education Bill, continuing to mislabel it and spread false narratives in an apparent attempt to indoctrinate children.\n\nFlorida\u2019s state Senate passed the measure this month, effectively sending it to Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019s desk. For weeks, the left has falsely label the legislation in an apparent attempt to deceive parents and voters, deeming it the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill. However, the bill is quite simple in that it bans inappropriate classroom discussions on gender identity and sexual orientation for children in kindergarten through third grade.\n\nThe text of the bill reads in part:\n\nClassroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\n\nDespite the left\u2019s steady stream of misinformation, the measure does not ban specific words or phrases. In fact, it does not even mention the word key to the left\u2019s mantra \u2014 \u201cgay.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou actually look at the bill, and it says no sexual instruction in grades pre-k through three. And so how many parents want their kindergarteners to have transgenderism or something injected into classroom instruction?\u201d DeSantis asked during a press conference this month, explaining it is providing assurances for parents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically saying for our youngest students \u2014 4-year-olds, 5-year-olds, 6 years and 7 \u2013 do you really want them to be being taught about \u2014 and this is any sexual stuff, but I think clearly right now we see a lot of focus on the transgenderism, telling kids that they may be able to pick genders and all that,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cYeah, you can create a false narrative, you can stage a protest, you can do all those things, but you\u2019re not telling the truth about what\u2019s actually there,\u201d DeSantis added.\n\nYet, activists and corporate media outlets have continued to perpetuate the lies, even as supposedly \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d companies such as Disney grovels to LGBT activists.\n\nThe company\u2019s CEO, Bob Chapek. essentially apologized or not being more outspoken against the Parental Rights in Education Bill and said Disney\u2019s leaders \u201cchose not to take a public position on it because we thought we could be more effective working behind-the-scenes, engaging directly with lawmakers \u2014 on both sides of the aisle.\u201d\n\nHe also said he contacted the governor \u201cto express our disappointment and concern that if the legislation becomes law, it could be used to unfairly target gay, lesbian, non-binary and transgender kids and families.\u201d He groveled further, asserting that he needs to be a \u201cstronger ally\u201d to gay and transgender employees. It remains unclear what that has to do with keeping age-inappropriate discussions out of the classrooms of young children.\n\n\u201cThe chance that I am going to back down from my commitment to students and back down from my commitment to parent rights simply because of fraudulent media narratives or pressure from woke corporations \u2014 the chances of that are zero,\u201d he said as a response.\n\n\u201cAnd when you have companies that have made a fortune of being family-friendly and catering to families and young kids, you know, they should understand that parents of young kids do not want this injected into their kid\u2019s kindergarten classroom,\u201d he added, blasting Disney for criticizing parents\u2019 rights but continuing to line its pockets through its relationship with the Communist Party of China (CCP).\n\nEven still, leftists have turned a blind eye to truth, pushing for transgender ideology to be introduced to 5, 6, 7, and 8-year-olds. Democrat Florida lawmakers have engaged in gay chants while activists beg people to donate to a \u201cSay Gay\u201d billboard campaign as part of an attempt to \u201chumiliate\u201d DeSantis and Republicans, although it remains unclear how that would do so:\n\nActress Gabrielle Union is among the throng of leftist celebrities who has touted the fake news, expressing disappointment over Disney\u2019s delayed reaction to the measure.\n\n\u201cSomebody asked me, \u2018Are you disappointed?\u2019 I\u2019m disappointed when my order isn\u2019t right at In-N-Out. I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s a word that you could use for something like this, where children\u2019s lives are literally hanging in the balance,\u201d she told Variety.\n\n\u201cWe need to own that if you truly are taking stands against hate and oppression, you should not fund hate and oppression. Period. The damage is done,\u201d she added.\n\nEven polling questions have misrepresented the measure, putting the left\u2019s mischaracterization front and center. However, what is perhaps most telling is, even in the dishonesty, half still support it. When asked in an honest manner, however, most voters say they would support a similar measure in their state.\n\nYet, leftists, including a slew of Democrat lawmakers, have continued to label the measure both \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201chomophobic.\u201d But DeSantis has not backed down.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I can tell you. In the state of Florida, we are not going to allow them to inject transgenderism into kindergarten,\u201d he said during a stop in Boca Raton this month.\n\n\u201cFirst graders shouldn\u2019t have woke gender ideology imposed in their curriculums, and that is what we\u2019re standing for. We\u2019re standing for the kids and we\u2019re standing for the parents,\u201d he continued:\n\nDays later, DeSantis urged people to \u201cget out of their bubble and actually talk to parents in this state because they do not want this in kindergarten or first grade or second grade.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear why leftists are determined to inject discussions on sexual orientation and gender identity into kindergarten classrooms, but one recent poll from The Economist/YouGov might provide a glimpse into their mentality, as 66 percent of Democrats apparently believe that an individual can be either a man or woman, regardless of their biological sex.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/03/15/ron-desantis-people-need-to-get-out-of-their-bubble-and-talk-to-parents/", "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/03/08/democrats-furious-that-florida-legislature-passed-bill-banning-sexual-orientation-discussions-for-5-year-olds/", "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/03/11/ron-desantis-doubles-down-we-are-not-going-to-allow-them-to-inject-transgenderism-into-kindergarten/", "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2022/03/18/gabrielle-union-attacks-disney-over-fl-anti-grooming-bill-you-should-not-fund-hate-and-oppression-period/", "https://twitter.com/KimMangone/status/1505750892556939265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/FLSenateDems/status/1500865436614893571?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/03/11/ron-desantis-disney-opposes-parental-rights-but-lines-pockets-with-communist-party-of-china-money/", "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/03/21/desperate-democrats-work-to-advance-lie-with-say-gay-billboards-in-florida/", "https://www.npr.org/2022/03/08/1085130633/disney-response-florida-bill-dont-say-gay", "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2022/03/12/disney-ceo-bob-chapek-grovels-to-lgbtq-employees-i-let-you-down-i-am-sorry/", "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/03/16/critics-still-mislabeling-floridas-parental-rights-in-education-bill/", "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/03/07/florida-democrat-lawmakers-perpetuate-dont-say-gay-bill-myth/", "https://t.co/AiXzW0chUq", "https://t.co/FxyDq0u0gp", "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/03/17/poll-majority-of-democrats-believe-changing-ones-biological-sex-is-possible/", "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/03/17/poll-most-voters-support-florida-bill-banning-inappropriate-classroom-discussions-k-3/"], "labels": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Say Gay", "weight": 0.07239713}, {"name": "parent rights", "weight": 0.06944002}, {"name": "young kids", "weight": 0.069009595}, {"name": "kindergarten classrooms", "weight": 0.06809837}, {"name": "parents", "weight": 0.06494674}, {"name": "young children", "weight": 0.061608408}, {"name": "inappropriate classroom discussions", "weight": 0.0590058}, {"name": "gender identity", "weight": 0.058810838}, {"name": "woke gender ideology", "weight": 0.058378685}, {"name": "Classroom instruction", "weight": 0.057140656}], "topics": [{"name": "LGBTQ"}, {"name": "Social Issues"}, {"name": "Trans Rights"}], "categories": [{"name": "Politics"}], "entities": [{"data": "Florida", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Boca Raton", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Parental Rights in Education Bill", "type": "LAW", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Senate", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Disney", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "the Communist Party of China", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "CCP", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "In-N-Out", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Variety", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "The Economist/YouGov", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ron DeSantis", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Bob Chapek.", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Gabrielle Union", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Democrat", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Republicans", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Say Gay", "type": "WORK_OF_ART", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.026025416, "negative": 0.5286638, "neutral": 0.44531068}, "summary": "However, the bill is quite simple in that it bans inappropriate classroom discussions on gender identity and sexual orientation for children in kindergarten through third grade.

According to Cooky, Thomas, a man living as a woman, has shattered the notion of the sex segregation of women that sports have often promoted.\n\n\u201cHow does one advocate for equitable treatment while also adhering to the notion of biological difference?\u201d asks Cooky. \u201cIf separate is not equal in the case of schools, bathrooms, restaurants or other social institutions, can separate ever truly be equal in the case of sports? Would gender-based discrimination in sports be eradicated if sports were gender-integrated?\u201d\n\nAfter hailing the NCAA for allowing transgender people to compete, Cooky then argues that scientific evidence does not show that transgender people have advantages over women, even though Thomas, who was ranked 462nd when competing with other men, has now suddenly dominated Olympic medalists.\n\n\u201cAttempts to ban or limit the participation of trans athletes are not based on science,\u201d she claims. \u201cInstead, they are rooted in societal and cultural definitions of what constitutes gender or what defines a woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch questions matter because sports are organized based on the belief of natural differences between men and women, and they are sex-segregated as a result,\u201d she adds. \u201cYet, this ultimately leads to the discrimination of athletes like Thomas.\u201d\n\nRecalling the landmark Supreme Court decision that desegregated public schools, Brown v. Board of Education, Cooky claims that sports have essentially been able to operate under a \u201cseparate but equal\u201d philosophy through sex segregation.\n\nThe presumed physical inferiority of girls and women historically has justified, legitimated and excused the unequal treatment of female athletes,\u201d she exclaims, citing the U.S. Soccer Federation\u2019s claim that \u201cthere were differences in speed and strength of the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams, which partly explained any disparities in pay.\u201d\n\nCharacterizing Lia Thomas as an agent of change, Cooky goes as far to compare him with the likes of Jackie Robinson:\n\nToday, athletes like Jackie Robinson are celebrated as \u2018breaking the color barrier\u2019 in sports, although that narrative often requires sanitizing, simplifying or rewriting a more complex, nuanced and contradictory history. There remains though a cultural investment in celebrating sports\u2019 \u2018firsts,\u2019 whether that be Robinson as the first Black MLB player, the first openly gay active player in the NBA, the first nonbinary U.S. athlete to participate in the Winter Olympics or the first woman to score in a Power Five college football game. Many of the athletes who become the \u2018first\u2019 encounter resistance, backlash and opposition, especially from those who have historically benefited from the status quo in sports.\n\nCooky is several months late to the Lia-Thomas-is-Jackie-Robinson game. In January, none other than Lia Thomas himself made the comparison, according to several teammates.\n\n\u2018I try not to be around her because the whole situation makes me so mad,\u2019 an anonymous teammate told the Washington Examiner. \u201cI don\u2019t think Lia is a bad person. She\u2019s very quiet and kind of introverted \u2026 It\u2019s just really hard for me to respect her at all because of what she\u2019s doing to my team and what she\u2019s doing to women in general

[and] Thomas was stronger at the end,\u201d NBC reported.\n\nAll of the women in the race were demoted one place by Thomas\u2019s victory. \u201cAll of us in life\u2019s competitive arena are on the way to becoming someone profoundly different than we were,\u201d Jenkins wrote, without using the words \u201cfemale\u201d or \u201csubordinate.\u201d\n\nSports is about personal liberation, regardless of yesterday\u2019s focus on fairness, teams, leagues, scores, rules, boundaries, definitions, or society, says Jenkins, the wealthy author of several best-sellers:\n\nWhat is the real aim and value of NCAA competition? Is it not to grow people? Surely, it\u2019s about more than just vaulting a small subset of young talents on to a podium for the sake of name-image-and-likeness deals and spots in the Olympics. It\u2019s supposed to be about exploring who you are, whether on the pool deck or starting block or basketball floor, and the truth is that \u201cevery person has multitudes in them,\u201d as [T.] Cooper\u2019s wife, journalist Allison Glock, observed in her own work. That\u2019s the real worthwhile inquiry of college sports. Using this as a starting point in the Thomas debate seems a much smarter approach than the uncivil fearmongering over bone density and hand size. And it allows you to ask without insult: Is Thomas\u2019s presence preventing other swimmers from finding out who they are?\n\nBesides, the difference between men and women is all very complicated, confounding, and confusing, she wrote. People, sex, sports are all very complex, and \u201cthe science remains unsettled,\u201d so the opponents of men in women\u2019s sports really have no foundation to demand fairness, she wrote.\n\nJenkins\u2019 argument is a noble-sounding response to the many polls that show the public wants sports to be about fair competition on level fields, within clear rules, and according to consistent definitions. \u201cRight now, our opposition wins the debate on trans youth in sports against any and all arguments we have tried for our side,\u201d admitted a recent \u201cMessaging Guide\u201d by the Transgender Law Center in California.\n\nOnce sports is no longer about fair competion, men would display their liberation in any sport, Jenkins suggests:\n\nPro-transgender sports can be a mechanism for progressives to transform society from the ugly caterpillar of traditional rules into a new butterfly of progressive possibility, according to a pro-transgender legal claim quoted by Jenkins:\n\nThere is no normal. There\u2019s common, there\u2019s typical, but there\u2019s no normal. Whether it\u2019s gender, physical or mental ability, or another categorization used to make assumptions about people, sports help break down barriers that society imposes. If we can begin to shift away from the mirage of normalcy and instead view deviations from the common through a lens of possibility, we can increase access to sports and all the benefits they provide.\n\nStill, progressives\u2019 welcome of transgender butterflies and rule-ending possibilities does not apply to the sources of their own wealth and status. For example, Jenkins is happy to have her books and university credentials guarded against copyright-violating, chrysalis-emerging butterflies by the very non-diverse chainmail fist of federal copyright law.", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/sports/lia-thomas-becomes-first-transgender-woman-to-win-ncaa-swimming-championship/3605073/",

But many. youths \u2014 especially girls \u2014 quit after they have cut their bodies or deepened their voices.\n\nYoutube also includes many videos of young people who detransitioned from transgenderism.\n\nIrish psychologist Stella O\u2019Malley founded Genspect, to help parents and children. She wrote March 12:\n\nDetransitioners have been badly treated by society, and we owe it to them to show up, lend them our ears, and make sure that others also hear about these issues. Too few people seem even to be aware that medical transition carries a very heavy medical burden on the body, and seldom lives up to the image of the promised sunlit uplands where you can apparently become a member of the opposite sex. The bitter reality is that we can\u2019t ever become another person.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible lie because you can\u2019t become anybody else,\u201d she said.\n\nThe transgender movement is diverse, with competing goals and priorities.\n\nThe movement includes masculine autogynephilic men who demand sex from lesbians, non-political people trying to live as idealized stereotypes of the opposite sex, and pre-pubescent children with childish views of sexuality.\n\nIt includes troubled young men fantasizing about being submissive women, lesbians trying to become men, teenage girls trying to flee a sexual environment twisted by pornography, and gay teenagers trying to escape their minority status by adopting an attempted mainstream male identity.\n\nIt also includes young people trying to \u201cde-transition\u201d back to their sex and alienated children being guarded by their loving parents from the transgender activists.\n\nIt includes feminists who wish to blur distinctions between the two sexes and people who glamorize the distinctions between the two complementary sexes.\n\nThe transgender environment also includes revenue-seeking drug companies and medical service providers, wealthy donors, ambitious politicians, manipulative teachers, and professional advocates.\n\nIt also includes sexual liberationists and many progressives who are eager to liberate people from their bodies, parents who are eager or willing to endorse transgender claims, and journalists eager to help their social peers.", "medium": "Article", "links":

legislation that will force insurance companies to cover \u201cgender-affirming\u201d medical treatment for people who claim to be \u201ctransgender\u201d or the opposite of their biological

undergo life-altering surgeries and other treatment are discriminated against by insurance companies:\n\nThe legislature finds that many transgender persons have experienced discriminatory treatment from health insurance providers when seeking coverage for gender\u2011confirming treatments. Insurance policies often cover therapies and surgeries like feminizing or masculinizing hormone therapies, voice therapies, chest augmentations or reductions, and genital surgeries for other purposes but deny the same treatments for purposes of gender affirmation. The legislature finds that these arbitrary assessments of medical necessity are not evidence-based and interfere with the patient-physician relationship. They also place transgender persons who are denied treatment at higher risk of suicide and depression. The legislature recognizes that, while federal health care guidelines previously prohibited health insurance and healthcare providers from discriminating on the basis of gender identity, these protections have been largely rolled back. Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to require health insurance companies to provide applicants and policy holders with clear information on the policy\u2019s coverage of gender transition treatments and to prohibit insurance companies from discriminating on the basis of gender identity.\n\nThe procedures covered under the bill, which is sponsored by the majority Democrat Hawaii state legislature, include:\n\nRachel Levine, a former pediatrician chosen by President Joe Biden to be the assistant secretary for health for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 who is also a man living as a woman \u2014 said, \u201cGender-affirming care is a supportive, non-judgmental model of health care that allows patients to explore and, if they decide, to pursue medical affirmation procedures.

If passed, the bill would effectively bar Americans\u2019 ability to preserve single-sex institutions \u2014 including womens\u2019 swimming contests \u2014 because the law enables men and women to select opposite-sex identities under the guise of \u201cgender identity.\u201d\n\nBiden quickly denounced nationwide efforts by state governments to legally preserve Americans\u2019 single-sex institutions from the aggressive pro-transgender advocates and legislators.\n\n\u201cThe onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong,\u201d he insisted.\n\nHe continued by promising to support the medical conversion of children into \u201ctransgender\u201d people: \u201cAs I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your president, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential.\u201d\n\nBut those treatments are risky, wounding, and normally irreversible. Breitbart News reported on February 25 that Sweden is ending its long-standing policy of allowing children and teenagers to undergo sex-related treatment:\n\nThe new guidelines are set to replace a prior 2015 guideline that recommended the use of puberty blockers for children as being \u201csafe and secure,\u201d broadcaster SVT reports. According to the health board, the risks of hormone treatments outweigh the benefits stating, \u201cPending\u2026 a research study, our assessment is that the treatments can be given in exceptional cases.\u201d Thomas Lind\u00e9n, Head of The National Board of Health and Welfare, also stated, \u201cThe studies available do not provide sufficient information about the treatment. We cannot rule out negative effects of it and we do not know if it is useful, it is always associated with problems and risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cBiden continues to double down on his commitment to a radical ideology which voters clearly reject,\u201d responded Terry Schilling, president of American Principles Project, which supports Americans\u2019 civic recognition that men and women are different and complementary. He continued:\n\nAmericans have watched with disbelief as biological males dominate women\u2019s sporting events. Families have been shocked to discover their young children in public schools are being coached into believing they can change their sex and encouraged to make life-altering medical decisions before they can even understand the consequences.

No government forms will include questions about \u201cgender identity\u201d or \u201csexual preference.\u201d No doctor will be allowed to perform irreversible surgical or gender-altering procedures on any minor child. Once they become adults, they can do what they wish. We will protect women\u2019s sports by banning biological males from competing. It is hugely unfair and would erase many of the gains women have made in athletics over the last 50 years.\n\nScott\u2019s promise to oppose transgenderism is a political no-brainer. Many polls show the American public is increasingly opposed to transgender activists\u2019 far-reaching demands, including government support for irreversible surgery and hormone treatment for children.\n\nScott\u2019s transgender policy \u2014 and the broader campaign platform \u2014 is getting applause.\n\n\u201cThis is exactly the type of platform GOP candidates should be running on this year,\u201d responded Terry Schilling, the president of the pro-family American Principles Project. He continued:\n\nAll of the most important \u2014 and electorally advantageous \u2014 issues are here, from opposing critical race theory in schools and defending women\u2019s sports to reining in Big Tech and protecting children from sexualization. If the Republican Party is serious about becoming the party of families, these are precisely the issues that must be a top priority.\n\n Establishment operatives at the RNC and elsewhere should take note: this is how the GOP will win elections, not by surrendering the culture war but by fighting back. Sen. Scott deserves major kudos for releasing such a bold plan, and Republican candidates everywhere would be smart to follow his lead.\n\nScott\u2019s platform will likely pressure many cautious GOP senators towards opposition to the transgender ideology. That pressure is important because many GOP politicians have been reluctant to challenge elite sympathy for the transgender ideology\u2019s society-wrecking demands. Those demands say the government should force Americans to accept claims by adults and children about their shifting sexual identity, regardless of the damage those claims do to other Americans, civic institutions, or the claimants\u2019 health.\n\nRepublican National Committee (RNC) chairwoman Ronna McDaniel endorsed Scott\u2019s campaign platform, but notably ignored the transgender aspect:\n\nThe transgender push to transform children and to end single-sex sports \u2014 such as swimming leagues for Ivy League women \u2014 are driving the public debate against the transgender demands.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to treat kids as kids,\u201d Scott told Breitbart News. \u201cMen shouldn\u2019t be taking over women\u2019s sports \u2026 we\u2019re going to kill women\u2019s sports. They\u2019re going to stop winning, just look at the NCAA championship swimming,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI do believe we ought to be careful about these gender-altering procedures on a child \u2026 This is science,\u201d he added.\n\nScott\u2019s plan follows a recent statement by former President Donald Trump. \u201cWe will ban men from participating in women\u2019s sports,\u201d he promised on January 29 during a Texas speech that mimicked a campaign rally.\n\nHe referred to the scandal of Lia Thomas, a transgender woman swimmer for the University of Pennsylvania, saying, \u201cSo ridiculous. Did you see the man who was on the swimming team at a certain school that I know very well? The [women\u2019s swimming] record was held for like 11 years. He beat it by 38 seconds.\u201d\n\nThe public has rejected transgenderism\u2019s ideological claim that the reality of sex is subordinate to each person\u2019s choice of her or his \u201cgender identity.\u201d Numerous polls show the public \u2014 including liberal women \u2014 increasingly rejects the transgender ideology. The new opponents include many liberal-leaning, college-educated women and men who hated former President Donald Trump and voted for Joe Biden in 2020. Even pro-transgender advocates admit they have lost the public argument over sex-switching athletes.\n\nFederal GOP politicians are moving away from initial support for the establishment-backed transgender agenda.\n\nFor example, Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) pushed an amendment to the coronavirus spending bill that would have barred federal funds for universities that allow men to compete in women\u2019s sports.\n\nOn January 9, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) ended her support for the pro-transgender Fairness for All Act bill. Reps. Claudia Tenney (R-NY) and Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ), also withdrew their support for the bill which would make \u201cgender identity\u201d a judicially-enforce civil right against Americans\u2019 single-sex associations, institutions, and community groups.\n\nRoughly 15 establishment-wing GOP members are still backing the pro-transgender legislation, including Rep. Peter Meijer (R-MI) and Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI).\n\nThe bill is strongly opposed by the American Principles Project:\n\nIn the states, numerous GOP politicians have already voted for legislation to curb the transgender ideology. Others are using their regulatory power to roll back the transgender expansions.\n\n\u201cWhat we really need is a [federal] civil rights style legislative package that addresses [the lack of] parental rights and family formation,\u201d said a statement from Schilling. He continued:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Republicans are finally seeing the political advantage of highlighting Democrat extremism on this issue,\u201d Schilling added. \u201cBut with the GOP seemingly poised to take back Congress next year, the question remains: Will they actually do something about it once they retake power? That will be the real test, and it will be critical that conservatives hold them to it.\u201d", "medium": "Article", "links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/PrideMonth?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw",

The issue is whether the establishment and its media can redefine the meaning of women and men, amid many polls that show growing public hostility to the transgender claim that \u201cgender identity\u201d is more important than male-or-female sex.\n\nThe New York Times showcased the don\u2019t-engage strategy on November 16, the day before Thomas dived into the pool with the Ivy League women. An article in the paper downplayed Thomas\u2019s male nature and instead played up past debates over standout female athletes. \u201cThe womanhood of women athletes was always questioned when they were really good,\u201d said a quote in the article, which was headlined, \u201cTrans Swimmer Revives an Old Debate in Elite Sports: What Defines a Woman?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a pathetic and misguided state that any argument against Thomas\u2019 participation is immediately deemed to be an indication of transphobia,\u201d Swimming World reported after Thomas\u2019s weekend smash-and-grab. \u201cNo, the arguments against Thomas are about fairness, and for the Ivy League to play the transphobia card is arrogant, ignorant, and insulting. Really, it is a sign of the conference taking a bully approach and using such a strong term to intimidate and deter those willing to speak out.\u201d\n\nBefore the meet, the Ivy League pro-transgender officials suppressed objections from women swimmers. But they allowed pro-transgender displays at the weekend event, according to an ESPN report February 19:\n\n\u201cAt the meet, the announcer opens with a warning against \u2018racist, homophobic, or transphobic discrimination,'\u201d said an on-scene report from Common Sense with Bari Weiss. \u201cThe parents say their daughters know it\u2019s wrong that Thomas is swimming against them but that they will not risk getting smeared with the label transphobe.\u201d\n\nThe Ivy League is using threats to silence criticism from women swimmers. For example, Swimming World reported on a letter from 16 swimmers who said:\n\nWe have been told that if we spoke out against her inclusion into women\u2019s competitions, that we would be removed from the team or that we would never get a job offer. When media have tried to reach out to us, these journalists have been told that the coaches and athletes were prohibited from talking to them. We support Lia\u2019s mental health, and we ask Penn and the Ivy League to support ours as well.\n\nThe displacement of the women was applauded by one of the women whose prizes were grabbed by Thomas, according to an article by ESPN\u2019s pro-transgenderism reporter:\n\nBOSTON \u2014 Miki Dahlke looked on as University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas sliced through the Blodgett Pool water on Friday night at the Ivy League women\u2019s swimming championships. By the end of the meet, Thomas\u2019 name had supplanted Dahlke\u2019s on three records, including the two set in this race. \u201cRecords are made to be broken,\u201d Dahlke said. \u201cI am a faster swimmer because of fast swimmers of the past, and the future of swimming will be faster because of the women at the top of the NCAA today.\u201d\n\nThe minimal media coverage also downplayed the many women who were pushed down in the rankings \u2014 and off the podium \u2014 by the Ivy League officials\u2019 support for the male swimmer. Swimming World reported:\n\nThomas and his Ivy League allies are also humiliating women by changing in their locker rooms, said Chart.\n\nThe public, however, is not accepting transgenderism\u2019s ideological claim that the reality of sex is subordinate to each person\u2019s choice of her or his \u201cgender identity.\u201d\n\nNumerous polls show the public \u2014 including liberal women \u2014 increasingly rejects the transgender ideology. The new opponents include many liberal-leaning, college-educated women and men who hated former President Donald Trump and voted for Joe Biden in 2020. Even pro-transgender advocates admit they have lost the public argument over sex-switching athletes.\n\nAmid the silence from the Democrats and their media allies, Trump is seizing the political opportunity. \u201cWe will ban men from participating in women\u2019s sports,\u201d he promised on January 29 during a Texas speech that mimicked a campaign rally.\n\nHe referred to the Thomas scandal, saying, \u201cSo ridiculous.

He beat it by 38 seconds.\u201d\n\nTransgender advocates \u201cnever had a strategy for having a public debate about this because they were hoping that it would all be done and settled [before anyone noticed],\u201d Chart said.

Rowling by spotlighting a subscriber named \u201cLianna\u201d who would like to see Rowling erased from the Harry Potter canon.\n\nThe ad campaign, which launched this week, promotes the newspaper\u2019s so-called \u201cindependent journalism\u201d while also promoting the Gray Lady as a lifestyle brand. The ads profile four different subscribers from different demographics, each of whom has apparently made the newspaper an integral part of their lives.\n\nIn one of the ads, \u201cLianna\u201d \u2014 who appears to be transgender or gender non-binary \u2014 engages in a free association of thoughts and ideas, which include \u201cbreaking the [gender] binary,\u201d spending a \u201cweek in crossword land,\u201d and \u201cimagining Harry Potter without its creator.\u201d\n\nThe Times is reportedly running the ads in major cities, including Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Atlanta. A version of the \u201cLianna\u201d ad appeared in the D.C. Metro system, including the attack on Rowling.\n\nRowling has come under vicious attack by transgender activists who object to her belief that gender is biological. The author has also expressed her concern that women are being degraded by terms like \u201cpeople who menstruate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives. It isn\u2019t hate to speak the truth,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nAs a result of her views, Hollywood has ostracized Rowling. The author has stated transgender activists have doxxed her and her family, and have sent her violent threats.\n\nThe New York Times ad has provoked heated debate on social media. Among the dissenters is acclaimed novelist Joyce Carol Oates, who blasted the newspaper for its \u201cshocking condescension.\u201d\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip?

So black and brown stripes were added to the rainbow as \u201ca symbolic representation of Philadelphia\u2019s commitment to centering the experiences, contributions, activism, and dedication of black and brown members of our community,\u201d said a city official.\n\nIn 2018, a designer moved the black and brown colors over to the left of the 1979 flag while adding the pink-and-blue colors of the transgender cause. DeZeeen.com reported in June 2018:\n\nMany gays and lesbians oppose the intrusive arrow because the transgender cause \u2014 and the racial causes \u2014 are fundamentally different from the gay and lesbian cause.\n\nGays and lesbians want respect, social status, and political recognition for their single-sex relationships.\n\nBut transgender groups fundamentally deny the existence of any stable sexual identity. They argue that a man can become a woman, and vice versa if they have an internal and unverifiable \u201cgender identity\u201d of the opposite sex.\n\nThe ideology claims that \u201cgender identity\u201d is independent of sexual desire \u2014 so a heterosexual man can declare himself to be a \u201ctransgender woman,\u201d complete with a \u201cfemale penis.\u201d\n\nMany \u201ctransgender\u201d men are cross-dressing heterosexuals, not gays. The Pentagon\u2019s medical records show that a very small share of people claim to be transgender, and less than 10 percent of them have cosmetic surgery on their genitals.\n\nSo transgenderism\u2019s denial of inherent male-bodied gayness, and female-bodied lesbianism, makes it a \u201chomophobic\u201d ideology, according to an April 2021 article in LesbianAndGayNews.com.\n\nTransgenderism reinforces traditional \u201cgender roles\u201d even as it tries to blur the public recognition of the biology-driven physical and psychological differences between males and females. Transgenderism performs this ide0logical flip by claiming that people actually change their sex once they adopt the clothes, works, or cultural preferences associated with men. For example, transgenderism argues that a girl tomboy is really a boy because she prefers to play with, and dress like, pre-teen boys.\n\nIn practice, say critics, this logic is hateful towards women \u2014 including lesbians \u2014 because it denies women the freedom to remain female if they want to live like men or work in male-dominated careers.\n\nThe hate is socially pressuring lesbians to convert themselves into \u201ctransgender men,\u201d say lesbians:\n\nThe number of dykes, of former lesbians, I know who have transitioned over the past 10 years is shocking. I\u2019m not talking about teenagers, but I\u2019m talking about grown-ass women. And I find this out mostly through social media like Instgram \u2014 I\u2019m scrolling through Instagram and another one of my friends comes out as non-binary or trans and shows off their top-surgery scars and announces their new name. This happened twice yesterday, twice while I\u2019m scrolling through Instagram. This is happening at such a bizarre rate. So for the first 18 years of my life, I need one trans person. And then the last 18 years of my life, literally half of the lesbians I know have transitioned or have decided that they\u2019re non-binary, and I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say half. It\u2019s just an immense and immense number. And it makes me feel like I am crazy that I am the only person within these circles saying, \u201cWait a second, guys, what are you all doing? What is going on here? Why have you all had top surgery? Why are you all changing your names? Why are the people that I knew 10 years ago as all lesbians \u2013why are you all men now? You hated men! You were anti-men! And now you\u2019re all men. What is going on here?\n\n\u201cI know that many lesbian, gay, and bisexual people are angry about the incursion of the alphabet soup into the movement to protect same-sex attraction in law and throughout public policy,\u201d feminist author Kara Dansky told Breitbart News. She continued:\n\nTransgenderism is powerful because it is paired with \u201ccritical queer theory,\u201d which is popular among young activists, says activist Natasha Chart.\n\nQueer theory, she told Breitbart News, is a run-amuck \u201cgrey goo\u201d idea that attacks all of the useful intellectual and legal distinctions that allow humans to understand and manage their complex lives and conflicted communities:\n\n\u201cIt is categorically homophobic \u2014 it\u2019s heterophobic for that matter,\u201d Chart added. \u201cIf a man can declare himself a [transgender] woman and insist that other men be attracted to him and that [relationship] should still be considered a heterosexual relationship, what do you even call that? That would be ridiculous.\u201d\n\nIf a lesbian is in a relationship with a woman who declares herself to be a transgender man, then transgender activists relabel the lesbian as a \u201cstraight\u201d heterosexual woman. And when a lesbian refuses to have sex with a \u201ctransgender\u201d man and his \u201cfemale penis,\u201d then the transgender advocates redefine her as a \u201ctransphobic\u201d bigot who enforces the \u201ccotton ceiling\u201d against the desires of men.\n\nBut the queer theory \u2014 and funding from wealthy donors \u2014 has overwhelmed the groups that once championed lesbians and gays.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of a single LGBT organization or formerly lesbian rights organization looking out for the interests of lesbian and gay men,\u201d Belissa Cohen told the Bay Area Reporter in September 2021. \u201cWe used to have lesbian bars, gay male bars, and now they\u2019re all \u2018queer.'\u201d\n\nThis queer theory ensures that progressives \u2014 including transgender activists \u2014 feel entitled to attack the distinct message pushed by the six-color rainbow flag.\n\n\u201cPride is about both progress and protest, [so] company involvement in Pride should focus on those in the community most in need of support and change,\u201d argued a June 2021 pro-transgender op-ed in Newsweek. \u201cRight now, that particularly means trans people and people of color,\u2019 the op-ed said.\n\n\u201cQueer liberation includes all of us which means we have to honor Black, brown, and trans identities in all queer liberation works,\u201d Rhode Island state Sen. Tiara Mack told CNN in August 2021.\n\nThe Philadephia politicians added the black and brown arrows to tout claims for Black and Hispanic rights. The transgender groups put themselves on the flag, just behind the black and brown arrows.\n\nOther activists then added a purple circle on a yellow background to tout the tiny population of \u201cintersex\u201d people who are born with some genetic, hormonal, or even physical features of the opposite sex:\n\nAdvocates for getting more women into prostitution added an umbrella:\n\nEnvironmentalists are also colonizing the rainbow flag:\n\nBlackshirted Antifa groups are annexing the flag for their purposes:\n\nThe progressive push is very aggressive. For example, it broke up the planned 2020 and 2021 gay pride parades in Boston. \u201cBoston Pride celebrated a half-century-plus of existence by collapsing into social panic and canceling itself,\u201d said an October 2021 report in Quillette.com. The collapse came after the group\u2019s organizers submitted:\n\nQueer theory and transgenderism are used as clubs by political activists, Chart said:\n\nUnsurprisingly, the progressives are pushing the rainbow flag to a smaller, narrower slice on the starboard side of the progressive flag:\n\nStill, gays and lesbians are jeering at the progressives\u2019 drive to seize space on the rainbow flag.\n\nThe progressive flag is aesthetically horrible and hideous, say gay activists:\n\nThe business-backed transgender ideology has captured and converted the gay rights movement into a revenue-maximizing commercial enterprise, says U.K gay author Dennis Noel Kavanagh:\n\nProgressives factions and businesses will keep adding more stripes to the rainbow flag, tweeted P.S. Real Talk:\n\nThe progressive flag needs an extra symbol to show progressive imperialism, said @DecChee:\n\n\u201cWhat a lot of us used to see as a happy flag of [lesbian and gay] liberation has become a banner of mob rule,\u201d said Chart,\n\nThe \u201cprogress flag looks like the perfect symbol of the \u2026 thuggery that has characterized every move that the gender identity movement has taken to attain power,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s become a threat and it looks like one \u2014 it looks like what it is.\u201d", "medium": "Article", "links":

Tony Award-winning director Sam Gold \u2014 who is known for his post-modern takes on the classics \u2014 will stage the production.\n\nThis will be the first time Asia Kate Dillon will perform on Broadway.

In the Elizabethan era, male actors played all the female roles because women were not allowed to act on stage.\n\nThe role of Malcolm in Macbeth is an important one, serving as a primary antagonist to the title character. At the end of the play. Malcolm becomes King of Scotland upon the killing of Macbeth.\n\nThe new Broadway production is being produced by Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, who are the producers of the James Bond movies.\n\nIn 2019, Dillon publicly called for non-gendered acting categories at the Emmys and Screen Actors Guild Awards.

But as she did, Thomas cruised along beside her, seeming as unhurried as if on a training swim. Thomas\u2019s broad shoulders and long arms, hallmark features of an elite swimmer, mimicked a windmill with the ease in which they pulled her along. Then came the final turn. As Shelton came out of it continuing to fight, on her way to a season-best time, Thomas, with her long, rhythmic, powerful stroke, ate up the margin between them until she had surged past for a near body-length victory. And so if there was something enduring about Saturday, it was not the two races that Thomas comfortably won or the two relays where she gamely tried. It was the way she carried herself in the water \u2014 head down, with grace and ease.\n\nThe NYT accepts and broadcasts the transgender claim that people can change their sex with a flip of their gender identity. For example, it posted an uncritical article about another man \u2014 Amy Schneider \u2014 who recently seized records for women on the Jeopardy! quiz show.\n\nBut the newspaper\u2019s readers oppose the claim \u2014 so the NYT blocked comments from its upper-income, Democrat-voting, liberal and progressive readers.\n\nBut the response via social media was a complete rejection of the article:\n\n\u201cI had no doubt that it was written by a man,\u201d responded @Catherine Weibel. \u201cYour lack of interest for whether/how this might impact women\u2019s right to a level playing field is striking.

You\u2019d never tell young men to forget their ambitions & celebrate their competitors\u2019 humanity instead!\u201d\n\n\u201cPS I don\u2019t know which is worse the rank SEXism or the bad prose,\u201d she added.\n\nThe transgender movement is diverse, with competing goals and priorities.\n\nLess than one percent of Americans claim to be transgender. Less than one in ten of the few men who claim to be transgender have their genitalia removed.\n\nThe movement includes heterosexual autogynephilic men who demand sex from lesbians, alienated young men fantasizing about being submissive women, lesbians trying to become men, teenage girls trying to flee a sexual environment twisted by pornography, and gay teenagers trying to escape their minority status by adopting an attempted mainstream male identity.\n\nIt includes non-political people trying to live as idealized stereotypes of the opposite sex, pre-pubescent children with childish views of sexuality, and ideologues who wish to blur distinctions between the two sexes.\n\nThe transgender environment also includes revenue-seeking drug companies and medical service providers, wealthy donors, ambitious politicians, manipulative teachers, and professional advocates.\n\nIt also includes sexual liberationists and progressives who are eager to liberate people from their bodies, parents who are eager or willing to endorse transgender claims, and journalists eager to help their social peers.\n\nThis movement is overwhelmingly opposed by the public, by doctors shocked at the psychological and healthcare damage, by a growing number of young people who have \u201cde-transitioned\u201d back to their sex, by parents trying to shield their children from transgender activists,

It\u2019s common sense and yet somehow NIH seems to need to have common sense put directly in front of them.\u201d\n\nAccording to Guillermo, after the European Parliament reviewed PETA\u2019s \u201cstraightforward\u201d strategy, it directed the European Commission to come up with a plan and timeline for phasing out animal research, as she warned the U.S. \u201cis already going to be falling behind our European allies.\u201d\n\nCiting the figures, she called out the \u201cillogical\u201d pursuit of failed methods.\n\n\u201cThe budget for these experiments is about $20 billion, which is so illogical,\u201d she said, noting it is \u201dabout half of NIH\u2019s budget.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got something that fails more than 90% of the time, and in some disease research areas it\u2019s 100% failure \u2014 such as drugs developed using animals for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, AIDS, neurological diseases, strokes, and sepsis \u2014 and you\u2019re spending 50% of your budget on that, that is just statistically illogical,\u201d she added.\n\nAmong some of the more extreme NIH experimentation \u201cfunded by Anthony Fauci\u2019s institute at NIH\u201d during the current pandemic, she noted, is the attempt to create transgender monkeys.\n\n\u201cThe idea by the experimenter who\u2019s at Scripps Research in Florida is to study HIV transmission among transgender women,\u201d she said, \u201cbut instead of actually working with transgender women, which could be done humanely and non-invasively and would yield results that actually mean something, he has chosen to take male monkeys and give them hormones so that he can \u2018feminize\u2019 them and they become models for transgender women.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s the only word I think that does it justice.\u201d\n\nCalling it \u201cabsurd on so many levels,\u201d she emphasized the ineffectiveness of such research.\n\n\u201cBeyond the obvious absurdity of trying to create a transgender monkey, monkeys don\u2019t even contract HIV,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t develop AIDS.\u201d\n\nThe overwhelming evidence for such, she said, was recently presented to Dr. Fauci by the group.\n\n\u201cWe had just gone to Dr. Fauci about a month ago with evidence that the 36 years of HIV experiments on monkeys that his institute has been funding have utterly failed to produce a vaccine for humans,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve produced lots of vaccines that work in monkeys who have a virus that\u2019s kind of like HIV but isn\u2019t,\u201d she added. \u201cBut when they try them in humans, they\u2019ve all failed.\u201d\n\nAccusing the NIH of having \u201clost their way,\u201d she listed several reasons she believed the failed experimentation continues.\n\n\u201cI think one of the reasons why it continues is that it has become the goal of most experimenters, most scientists at universities that are funded by NIH and within NIH, to publish a paper, not really to produce a treatment or cure or a vaccine,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd publishing papers is a lot easier than making real change, so that\u2019s part of it,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have to stop rewarding that in the absence of actual progress.\u201d\n\nAnother reason, she noted, is due to bureaucratic procedures and attempts to maintain budgets.\n\n\u201cThe other problem is there\u2019s a certain bureaucratic inertia and many of the people on the committees that review proposals for research projects are themselves animal experimenters,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they know. They go to college, they learn how to study a particular thing using animals, they spend their whole careers doing it without ever evaluating whether or not it\u2019s useful, and then they approve people who come up behind them for the same thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, we really need to get people in there who have an understanding of modern research methods,\u201d she added.\n\nGuillermo then expanded on the many alternative methods of performing necessary research.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of them, and we\u2019re seeing some uses of them by the pharmaceutical industry \u2014 the ones with the 95% failure rate on new medications that seem to work in animals, don\u2019t work in humans,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of these are the organ-on-a-chip technology \u2014 the computer modeling of organ systems, which are really sophisticated using supercomputers, artificial intelligence, and the wise and humane use of epidemiological and clinical studies with humans too.\u201d\n\n\u201cUltimately, humans are the ones that everything is tested on in the end because animals just really aren\u2019t good stand-ins for humans, so doing this wisely from the beginning can make a huge difference,\u201d she added.\n\nCalling the fight for humane animal treatment in research \u201ca bipartisan issue on the Hill, which I find encouraging,\u201d she credited Republicans with leading on these issues.\n\n\u201cIn my experience at PETA, so often, it\u2019s the Republicans who are leading the way on this,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite the \u201cwide bipartisan support on the Hill,\u201d Guillermo admitted that Dr. Fauci \u201chas not responded to any of our queries yet,\u201d adding she was unaware if he had even responded to Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) who had demanded Fauci answer for \u201ccruel, taxpayer-funded experiments on puppies\u201d and with whom PETA is currently working with.\n\nGuillermo was unambiguous about her thoughts on Dr. Fauci\u2019s role at NIH.\n\n\u201cI think Fauci should be fired and so should every other director at NIH right now because they\u2019re perpetuating the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no problem saying that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in the way and they need to get out of the way,\u201d she added.\n\nNoting that when \u201cany other line of work produces a 90 to 100% failure rate, usually methods are changed,\u201d Guillermo called for a new NIH head to change its ways.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really what we\u2019re encouraging here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to have somebody in charge at NIH, and this will be down to President Biden to appoint somebody worthy of this position, who can take NIH, shake it up, turn it upside down, get rid of the deadwood.\u201d\n\nHowever, Guillermo did not indicate a specific individual to replace Dr. Fauci.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a particular person I have in mind,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there are probably many good people.\u201d\n\nShe then listed the key qualifications she believed a new head must have.\n\n\u201cFirst, a new director needs to be aware of the information on the failure of animal studies,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd just as important, they need to be willing to lead because we saw even with [NIH Director Dr.] Francis Collins when he came into that position at the beginning of his tenure, he acknowledged the failure of animal studies to translate to human studies and he got tremendous pushback by the animal experimenters,\u201d she added, \u201cand rather than standing up for what he knew was right, he just caved in and said, \u2018OK, you\u2019re right. We just need to improve the animal experimenters.\u2019\u201d\n\nCalling for a director \u201cwho can really lead in the true sense of the word and who won\u2019t be dominated by political factions within the NIH,\u201d she spoke of the need \u201cto accept the strategy that we\u2019ve put forth in our research modernization deal, which is very straightforward.\u201d\n\nLast month, PETA senior vice president of cruelty investigations Daphna Nachminovitch accused the NIH of involvement in a $1.2 million contract to purchase beagles for \u201ccruel experiments.\u201d\n\nIn October, a non-profit organization called White Coat Waste Project accused Dr. Fauci and the NIH of partially funding experiments in Tunisia, North Africa, that locked beagles\u2019 heads in cages while hordes of hungry sandflies ate them alive.\n\nThe non-profit also said it obtained documents through a FOIA request showing that the NIH, led by Fauci, gave Kansas State University $536,311 to conduct an experiment involving hundreds of ticks feasting on live beagle puppies injected with mutant bacteria.", "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "animal research", "weight": 0.08662461}, {"name": "animal experiments", "weight": 0.08658966}, {"name": "animal studies", "weight": 0.07961194}, {"name": "animal experimentation", "weight": 0.0776571}, {"name": "animal experimenters", "weight": 0.07653855}, {"name": "NIH", "weight": 0.07374012}, {"name": "animals", "weight": 0.0726664}, {"name": "Dr. Fauci", "weight": 0.071684405}, {"name": "humane animal treatment", "weight": 0.071473725}, {"name": "such failed experiments", "weight": 0.06839296}], "topics": [{"name": "Anthony Fauci"}, {"name": "LGBTQ"}, {"name": "Social Issues"}, {"name": "Trans Rights"}], "categories": [{"name": "Politics"}], "entities": [{"data": "Breitbart News", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "PETA", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 7}, {"data": "White House", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "NIAID", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the National Institutes of Health", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "NIH", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 19}, {"data": "Scripps Research", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Hill", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Kansas State University", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Anthony Fauci", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 11}, {"data": "Kathy Guillermo", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 8}, {"data": "Nancy Mace", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Biden", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Francis Collins", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Daphna Nachminovitch", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Republicans", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "European", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "U.S.", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Florida", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "SC", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Tunisia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "North Africa", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.05356449, "negative": 0.20168622, "neutral": 0.7447493}, "summary": "\n\n\u201cThere have been a number of papers published showing that animal experimentation is failing to lead to treatments for humans,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s acknowledged by the National Institutes of Health and by the people who use animals.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut for some reason, NIH seems incapable of changing its practices,\u201d she added. \n\nAs a result, the group has created a strategy which includes phasing out animal experiments.\n\n\u201cSo our scientists developed what we call the \u2018research modernization deal\u2019 and it outlines the reasons for ending animal experimentation,\u201d she said. \u201c \n\nDespite the \u201cwide bipartisan support on the Hill,\u201d Guillermo admitted that Dr. Fauci \u201chas not responded to any of our queries yet,\u201d adding she was unaware if he had even responded to Rep.

If you\u2019re a transgender woman, you can apply. If you\u2019re a trans man, no. But if you transitioned to male after you get to Hollins, you can stay. And that\u2019s an important shift. Before 2019, if you transitioned while at Hollins, you\u2019d have to transfer out. Finally, if you\u2019re nonbinary, Hollins says no, your application will not be accepted.

Credentialed media at Saturday\u2019s meet included Fox News, Newsweek, the Daily Mail and ESPN. Tennis icons Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert have publicly said Thomas has no business competing in women\u2019s swimming, as has Olympian Erika Brown, who said last month it\u2019s \u201ctime to start standing up for women\u2019s sports.\u201d Nancy Hogshead-Makar, chief executive of Champion Women, a women\u2019s sports advocacy organization, said concerns around Thomas\u2019s spot on the women\u2019s team aren\u2019t rooted in transphobia or discrimination. Hogshead-Makar\u2019s issues are with the rule book that allows Thomas to compete in women\u2019s sports and with sports officials whom the advocate argues are putting Thomas\u2019s competitors at a disadvantage. \u201cThis topic is very uncomfortable for people. They don\u2019t understand it, and so they took the lazy way out,\u201d said Hogshead-Makar, who won four swimming medals at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. \u201cThe lazy way out is saying, \u2018Put them in the women\u2019s category.\u2019 \u201cTo blow up the women\u2019s category is just not the answer.

Overall, \u201cwe can at best elicit sympathy, a passive and often patronizing attitude that alienates our base [of current supporters] and fails to generate sustained interest from persuadable audiences\u201d of swing voters, said the guide, which is titled \u201cTransgender Youth and the Freedom to Be Ourselves.\u201d The counter-strategy is to stealthily hook their aggressive ideology to the public\u2019s existing sympathy for poor people, women, and racial minorities, according to the messaging guide: [Advocates should use] \u201c\u2026the Race Class Narrative to tell a convincing story of how \u2026 by coming together, we can ensure we all have the freedom to be ourselves and support one another.\u201d\n\nThe guide offered several examples of how the advocacy can be concealed, including an ironically titled \u201cAuthentic Selves\u201d pitch that matches the New York Times\u2019s coverage of the Jeopardy! sex scandal:\n\nAcross our races, backgrounds and genders, we want to be treated with dignity and respect. But today, certain politicians are pushing laws that restrict our freedoms because of the color of our skin, what\u2019s in our wallets, or because we are transgender. They exploit divisions and fears among us so they can get and hold onto power, denying us the basic rights, resources, and respect all people deserve. By [rejecting this division and] passing protections against discrimination, we can ensure each one of us has the freedom to be ourselves, pursue our dreams, and have a good life \u2014 no exceptions.\n\nThe advocacy group downplayed the huge health and psychological costs for people who claim to be transgender. But even the Washington Post\u2019s op-ed section spotlighted the dangers in November.\n\n\u201cWe may be harming some of the young people we strive to support \u2014 people who may not be prepared for the gender transitions they are being rushed into,\u201d said a Washington Post op-ed by the two prominent advocates of the transgender ideology, psychologist Laura Edwards-Leeper, and Erica Anderson, who says she is transgender.\n\nThe article was given a very prominent position \u2014 three-quarters of the first page in the Washington Post\u2019s prestigious Outlook section on Sunday, November 28.\n\nThe New York Times has yet to address the transgender sex scandal, despite its extensive coverage of the #MeToo sexual-assault scandal.", "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "women", "weight": 0.090445966}, {"name": "transgender advocacy", "weight": 0.08403751}, {"name": "transgender activists", "weight": 0.0757603}, {"name": "Male swimmer Lia Thomas", "weight": 0.07061087}, {"name": "Lia Thomas", "weight": 0.06797808}, {"name": "Thomas", "weight": 0.06317112}, {"name": "sports officials", "weight": 0.06270311}, {"name": "sports", "weight": 0.05974767}, {"name": "poor people", "weight": 0.056676727}, {"name": "people", "weight": 0.054955017}], "topics": [{"name": "LGBTQ"}, {"name": "Social Issues"}, {"name": "Trans Rights"}], "categories": [{"name": "Health"}, {"name": "Politics"}], "entities": [{"data": "The Washington Post", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Fox News", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Newsweek", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Daily Mail", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "ESPN", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Champion Women", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Transgender Law Center", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the New York Times\u2019s", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Jeopardy", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Outlook", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Democratic", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Lia Thomas", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 7}, {"data": "Rick Maese", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Martina Navratilova", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Chris Evert", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Erika Brown", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Nancy Hogshead-Makar", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Laura Edwards-Leeper", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Erica Anderson", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Los Angeles Olympics", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "#MeToo", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "a \u201cMessaging Guide\u201d", "type": "WORK_OF_ART", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Transgender Youth and the Freedom to Be Ourselves", "type": "WORK_OF_ART", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Authentic Selves", "type": "WORK_OF_ART", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "California", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.0221659, "negative": 0.7216409, "neutral": 0.25619322}, "summary": "The Washington Post finally mentioned the Ivy League sex-and-swimming scandal, and the reaction from its liberal Democratic readers is overwhelming; Male swimmer Lia Thomas does not belong in women\u2019s swim races, even if he thinks he has a woman\u2019s \u201cgender identity.\u201d\n\nAuthor Rick Maese\u2019s January 10 article tried to thread the needle between his pro-transgender peers and the newspapers\u2019 pro-fairness, pro-women readers: Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of tweeted responses to the article were scornful of the claim that men who claim to be women should be allowed to participate in women\u2019s sports: \n\nBreitbart News reported on December 30 about how the advocacy group is urging allies to conceal transgender advocacy under sympathy for various other groups:\n\n\u201cRight now, our opposition wins the debate on trans youth in sports against any and all arguments we have tried for our side,\u201d admits a \u201cMessaging Guide\u201d by the California-based Transgender Law Center.

They beat me and I was screaming and then I was unconscious,\u201d Husseini told the outlet, adding that \u201cthe attackers burned his feet,\u201d according to Tolo. Husseini added that the attack was the second in as many years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why and for how long I will be facing these problems. They beat us and insult us,\u201d Husseini lamented.\n\nThe incident occurred in Herat, western Afghanistan, where Tolo News noted transgender people had long complained of a \u201clack of protection\u201d from gang attacks and general street harassment.\n\nComplicating matters is the return of the Taliban jihadist government in Kabul. The Taliban took over the city in August as a result of President Joe Biden breaking an agreement that Washington had made with the terrorists last year. Under President Donald Trump, the Taliban had agreed not to attack foreign forces or maintain ties with jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda if the American military fully withdrew from the country by May 1, 2021. Biden chose to break the agreement and extend the 20-year Afghan civil war, inviting a nationwide campaign on the Taliban\u2019s part that saw tens of thousands of attacks and, often, the bloodless surrender of Afghan forces in major cities. By August 15, the Taliban simply walked into Kabul as former President Ashraf Ghani packed up millions in cash and fled the country.\n\nThe Taliban initially announced that it had changed since its brutal rule in the 1990s, characterized by regular public executions and extreme beatings and torture of women, suspected LGBT people, and anyone whose behavior authorities classified as anti-Islamic. While asserting they would implement Sharia, or Islamic law, nationwide, Taliban jihadists promised an \u201cinclusive\u201d government. That \u201cinclusivity\u201d \u2013 which the Taliban never implemented, as all major government positions are currently in the hands of Taliban terrorists \u2013 never included LGBT people.\n\n\u201cLGBT \u2026 That\u2019s against our Sharia law,\u201d Taliban \u201cfinance ministry\u201d spokesman Ahmad Wali Haqmal told Reuters in October.\n\nReports rapidly surfaced of incidents of violence against LGBT Afghans and those suspected of being so following the Taliban\u2019s return to power, many at the hands of suspected low-level Taliban terrorists. In Kabul, a gay man identified by the pseudonym Hanan was among the many reportedly targeted by suspected Taliban jihadists through false solicitations for a meeting. ITV News reported that \u201cHanan\u201d had been desperately seeking to connect with anyone who could guarantee his exit from the country in the aftermath of the Taliban taking Kabul when Taliban jihadists contacted him, claiming they could help him if they met.\n\n\u201cTwo people raped him, they beat him, and then demanded his father\u2019s number so they could tell him his son was gay,\u201d according to ITV.\n\nThe organization Rainbow Railroad, which helps LGBT people escape deadly conditions in repressive countries, confirmed in November to France 24 that Afghans had notified it that people unrelated to the organization were pretending to be so and offering to help them acquire passports and visas, a report consistent with stories like Hanan\u2019s. Kimahli Powell, the executive director of Rainbow Road, told France 24 that the organization had reason to believe the Taliban had compiled a \u201ckill list\u201d of LGBT Afghans using requests from abroad to get them out.\n\n\u201c[Some] individuals who have reached out to us have told us about how they\u2019ve received a mystery email from someone claiming to be connected with Rainbow Railroad asking for their information and passport,\u201d Powell said at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s how we know the information has been leaked.\u201d\n\nLGBT people stuck in the country have told international outlets that they fear they have no way to continue living normally under the Taliban.\n\n\u201cI am terrified. It\u2019s like a nightmare. I don\u2019t feel safe even in my room. I\u2019m scared of the Taliban,\u201d a transgender person identified as Laila told the Guardian in September. \u201cWhen I see them I feel they will know who I am and they will come to beat me, kick me or send me to prison.\u201d\n\nThe outlet documented growing terror among LGBT people that any unknown phone call or email could be Taliban jihadists attempting to target and attack them.\n\nAfghanistan was not hospitable to LGBT people \u2013 outside of those practicing the child rape tradition of bacha bazi \u2013 under the U.S.-backed government. Afghanistan was an Islamic republic governed under sharia where homosexuality was a crime. Under the Taliban, however, any LGBT identity is punishable by death.\n\nBiden promised to prioritize LGBT rights if elected president while campaigning last year.\n\n\u201cHate and discrimination against LGBTQ+ people started long before [former President Donald] Trump and [former Vice President Mike] Pence took office,\u201d Biden\u2019s official campaign websites reads. \u201cDefeating them will not solve the problem, but it is an essential first step in order to resume our march toward equality.\u201d\n\nBiden promised to withhold funding to countries that persecute gay people as a candidate and has appointed several LGBT officials in the White House, most prominently Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. In February, he signed a memorandum \u201cdirecting all U.S. government departments and agencies engaged abroad to ensure that U.S. diplomacy and foreign assistance promote and protect the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) persons around the world.\u201d\n\nAs president, Biden\u2019s State Department posted pro-LGBT messages online through its now-shuttered Kabul embassy.", "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "suspected LGBT people", "weight": 0.09428562}, {"name": "LGBT people", "weight": 0.092619054}, {"name": "suspected Taliban jihadists", "weight": 0.09120208}, {"name": "Taliban jihadists", "weight": 0.08888425}, {"name": "Taliban terrorists", "weight": 0.08774499}, {"name": "Taliban", "weight": 0.084365934}, {"name": "transgender people", "weight": 0.08069671}, {"name": "gay people", "weight": 0.07987146}, {"name": "LGBTQ+ people", "weight": 0.07445608}, {"name": "people", "weight": 0.07299822}], "topics": [{"name": "Asia"}, {"name": "LGBTQ"}, {"name": "Social Issues"}, {"name": "Trans Rights"}, {"name": "Taliban"}], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "Afghan", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "American", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "anti-Islamic", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Tolo News", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Taliban", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 21}, {"data": "al-Qaeda", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Reuters", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "ITV News", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Rainbow Railroad", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "France 24", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Guardian", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the White House", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Transportation", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "State Department", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Abdul Sabor Husseini", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Joe Biden", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Donald Trump", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Ashraf Ghani", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ahmad Wali Haqmal", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Hanan", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Kimahli Powell", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Laila", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "[former Vice President", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Mike] Pence", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Pete Buttigieg", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Herat", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Afghanistan", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Kabul", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Washington", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "U.S.-backed", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Sharia", "type": "LAW", "mentions": 2}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.036407154, "negative": 0.6181385, "neutral": 0.3454544}, "summary": "\n\nThe Taliban initially announced that it had changed since its brutal rule in the 1990s, characterized by regular public executions and extreme beatings and torture of women, suspected LGBT people, and anyone whose behavior authorities classified as anti-Islamic.

But roughly 102 black respondents strongly denied that claim \u2014 which is a core element of the transgender ideology.\n\nOverall, only eight percent of the roughly 150 black Americans in the poll they disagreed \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d with the claim \u201cthere are [only] two genders, male and female.\u201d\n\nBut 82 percent of black respondents agreed with the two-sex option \u2014 14 percent somewhat, and 68 percent strongly.\n\nThe respondents \u2014 nearly all of whom vote Democrat \u2014 were sharply different from the pro-transgender views of progressives who direct much of the party\u2019s policies. Overall, 31 percent of Democrats embraced the claim that there are multiple genders \u2014 although 61 percent of Democrats disagreed with that transgender claim.\n\nThis intra-party split is a problem for top Democrats because they have rallied behind the transgender claim amid growing public opposition. Some of that growing opposition is caused by sports scandals where men \u2014 who claim they are transgender \u2014 are able to push women athletes off of the prize podiums while their womens\u2019 parents and friends watch.\n\nRepublican voters overwhelmingly oppose the transgender ideology, as do swing-voting independents, according to the Rasmussen poll.

Laidlaw, M.D. and colleagues wrote a letter to the editor of the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (JCEM) regarding a study by Milou C. Madsen, et al, published in the journal in February.\n\nThe study, which attempted to measure the risk of erythrocytosis, an increase in the number of red blood cells due to the administration of testosterone to females seeking to transition to male, uses a methodology that leads to \u201ca significant undercount of patients who may ultimately be at risk for cardiovascular events,\u201d Laidlaw et al assert in their letter.\n\n\u201cIn our opinion, the study by Madsen et al. in JCEM hides the true numbers of trans males at risk for high red blood cell counts and therefore cardiovascular harms,\u201d the authors write at website Gender Sanity.\n\nThey explain differing red blood cells lab measures for the two sexes:\n\nMales and females have different laboratory ranges for hematocrit (red blood cells). For adult men the range is 38.3 to 48.6 percent. For adult women the range is 35.5 to 44.9 percent. High testosterone levels can directly cause high levels of hematocrit. Females who identify as trans males are given very high doses of testosterone to attempt to bring their testosterone levels into the male range.\n\n\u201cWomen who identify as trans males are being given very high, very risky doses of testosterone,\u201d Laidlaw explained to Breitbart News about his concerns. \u201cThese high doses lead to high red blood cell counts. High red blood cell counts can lead to heart attacks and death. We believe these risks are being hidden.\u201d\n\n\u201cMales and females have different normal ranges for red blood cell counts,\u201d he elaborated. \u201cWe believe that the authors\u2019 use of the male range for females hides a large number of females who will be at risk for heart disease and death.\u201d\n\nLaidlaw and colleagues, Andre Van Mol, M.D., Quentin Van Meter, M.D., and Jeffrey E Hansen, Ph.D., note results of the 1994 landmark Framingham study which showed \u201chaving high red blood cell counts (erythrocytosis) puts females at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease and death due to both.\u201d\n\n\u201cStudies of trans males have already shown up to a nearly five fold increased risk of myocardial infarction compared to females not taking testosterone,\u201d the doctors explain at Gender Sanity, adding:\n\nIn the study we have critiqued, the authors use what is considered very high hemoglobin levels in males (greater than 50) for trans males (females). This is a difference of 5 whole units compared to the Framingham study (greater than 45). This difference leads to a dramatic undercount of the number of females who will likely be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death because of high red blood cell counts due to very high levels of testosterone.\n\n\u201cPhysicians advocating for high levels of testosterone, such as Stephen Rosenthal, have argued that a person\u2019s gender identity should determine these hormone levels,\u201d Laidlaw et al observed.\n\nThe endocrinologist explained to Breitbart News transgender industry physicians \u201cbelieve a person\u2019s gender identity (which is a mental belief) can change physical reality and, therefore, what constitutes normal laboratory ranges for males and females.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is, of course, impossible,\u201d Laidlaw said. \u201cNot only that, it\u2019s also dangerous because doctors will miss a large number of trans males who are risking heart attacks and death from testosterone.\u201d\n\nLaidlaw and his colleagues instead \u201cpropose that the female reference range for hemoglobin and hematocrit be used for trans males so that both clinicians and patients can help more accurately assess risk factors for cardiovascular disease and death.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Laidlaw issues a warning about adolescent girls being considered for testosterone treatments.\n\n\u201cBecause adolescents are prone to risk-taking and lack maturity, we believe that they should never be prescribed testosterone,\u201d he said.", "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "High red blood cell counts", "weight": 0.116367914}, {"name": "high red blood cell counts", "weight": 0.116367914}, {"name": "High testosterone levels", "weight": 0.11403639}, {"name": "red blood cell counts", "weight": 0.10672641}, {"name": "red blood cells", "weight": 0.104038246}, {"name": "trans males", "weight": 0.09674114}, {"name": "high levels", "weight": 0.09635639}, {"name": "differing red blood cells lab measures", "weight": 0.089463696}, {"name": "high doses", "weight": 0.08625911}, {"name": "increased risk", "weight": 0.08420552}], "topics": [{"name": "LGBTQ"}, {"name": "Social Issues"}, {"name": "Trans Rights"}], "categories": [{"name": "Health"}], "entities": [{"data": "California", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Michael K.

Her appointment appears to be fully in line with the Girl Guides\u2019 policy on \u2018transgenderism\u2019\u2026\n\nWhat the organisation fails to explain is why it felt it had to introduce this policy. Nevertheless, they seem content to have marked their own homework on the matter:\n\nIn line with our values of inclusion and changing as the lives of girls change, it\u2019s important that we welcome trans girls and women. Our UK-wide annual survey into the views of girls and young women, the Girls\u2019 Attitudes Survey, helps us to understand the changing lives of girls today. It found that 86% of girls and young women aged 11-21 believe people should not be discriminated against because they are transgender.\n\nBut the general public appears unimpressed. When the Girl Guides announced its policy in May on Twitter, comments were almost universally negative.\n\nNot only does inclusion of males in female spaces pose a risk to the females, but it also distorts reality when girls are forced to collude in the lie that boys are girls. Even if that boy who says he\u2019s a girl is a lovely, gentle child, the girls are being gaslit. It is abusive. Any organisation which gaslights my daughters into believing they should accept males into their safe spaces does not get my support. My daughter is not going back to her rainbows unit. The safety and dignity of girls has been left behind in your pursuit of woke cookies.\n\nTwitter threads on Sulley/Tetley have generated more outrage still:\n\nOf course, if we are to believe transgender activists, the kind of people who say this sort of thing are either TERFs (trans-exclusionary radical feminists) or common or garden transphobes. Either way, according to current woke thinking, such reactionary responses should be ignored.\n\nBut the relevant branch of the Girl Guides clearly isn\u2019t happy with the attention because it has removed the page from its website giving details of its team members.\n\nIn a statement, Angela Salt OBE, CEO of Girlguiding who joined the organisation from the Tony Blair Faith Foundation in 2019 told Breitbart London:\n\nThe safety and wellbeing of our members is our absolute priority. We follow rigorous recruitment and vetting procedures, have clear policies, and a volunteer code of conduct which volunteers are expected to follow to keep our members safe.

The poll asked:\n\nLess than 40 percent of the respondents agreed that people can change their sex, according to the Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll, which also reported that 62 percent of all voters said, \u201cpeople are born with their gender.\u201d\n\nThis biology-beats-gender result adds more evidence that public opinion is moving against the transgender ideology.\n\nIn 2019, the Harvard/Harris team asked 1,295 registered voters: \u201cDo you think that transgender people should be required to use the bathroom of their sex at birth or allowed to use the bathroom that best aligns with their gender identity and stated sex?\u201d\n\nThe 2019 respondents were split 50/50. So the 62/38 result in 2021 suggests that the public\u2019s view has moved at least 20 points towards the biology-trumps-gender side of the debate in the last couple of years.\n\nHowever, most Democrats still support the claim that feelings of gender are more important than biology for purposes of classifying people in a complementary male-and-female society where less than one percent of people try to live as members of the opposite sex.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 support for transgenderism has grown since Democratic leaders embraced the ideology under President Barack Obama. For example, the new Harvard/Harris poll showed that 59 percent of Democrats agree with the claim that \u201cPeople should be able to choose their gender.\u201d\n\nThe October Harvard/Harris poll results are backed up by data from a poll taken in August by the pro-transgender Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI).\n\nThe PRRI poll used \u201cgender\u201d as a substitute for sex when asking a question, to which 40 percent of Americans responded by saying there are more genders than male and female.\n\nA second Harvard/Harris question in the October 2021 poll showed even less support for the transgender claim that the federal government should let people determine their own diverse sex other than male or female: Just 28 percent of people say there are \u201cmore than two genders,\u201d according to the Harvard/Harris poll.\n\nTransgender activists insist there are many more \u201cgenders\u201d than male and female. The claimed extra identities include \u201cagender,\u201d \u201candrogyne,\u201d \u201cbigender,\u201d \u201cdemiboy,\u201d and \u201cdemigender.\u201d\n\nGenerally, transgender advocates claim that a person\u2019s sense of their male-or-female nature \u2014 their \u201cgender\u201d \u2014 should be more important in law and society than the male-or-female nature of their unchangeable biology.\n\nFor example, advocates claim that federal law-enforcement agencies must ensure that a man or child who says his or her gender is different from his or her biology should be allowed to use opposite-sex bathrooms. They also demand that law enforcement force other Americans to treat them as the opposite sex in conversations, workplaces, cultural events, and even in sexual activities.\n\nMany polls show that the transgender claim is deeply rejected by most Americans \u2014 even as it is championed by ambitious progressives who promote social diversity to help fracture the civic power of ordinary Americans. This ruthless political agenda imposes a huge personal cost of near-universal sexual rejection, social isolation, and medical traumas on the few people who try to change their sexual appearance.\n\nThe public debate over transgenderism is conducted in school meetings, state legislatures, and in mainstream publications, such as Breitbart News. Few journalists in the establishment media have the freedom to disagree with their pro-transgender progressive peers. The public debate over the transgender issue is skewed and suppressed by progressive employees at the major tech companies, including Google, Facebook, and Twitter.\n\nThe PRRI polls also show the public is increasingly rejecting the transgender claim.\n\nFor example, the PRRI survey showed that \u201cone-third of Americans (36%) believe that these [male] students should be allowed to participate in [female] sporting events.\u201d That is a one-third drop from 2018 when a similar PRRI poll claimed that 50 percent of Americans said they were okay with male transgenders playing in girls\u2019 sports.\n\nThe PRRI poll also showed a two-year, one-third drop in the share of people who believe there are additional genders than male and female. In 2021, only 17 percent of Americans strongly believe there are multiple \u201cgenders,\u201d down from 24 percent in a prior 2019 PRRI poll.\n\n\u201cGlenn Youngkin\u2019s victory [in Virginia\u2019s election for governor] showed that voters, and especially parents, are waking up to the horrendous consequences of the woke left\u2019s gender ideology, in particular the way that it threatens the privacy and safety of girls in school,\u201d according to a statement from the American Principles Project, which is helping to organize state-level opposition to the transgender ideology.\n\n\u201cIt should be no surprise to see opinions shifting in polling on these issues as well,\u201d the statement added.", "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "gender ideology", "weight": 0.09769604}, {"name": "more genders", "weight": 0.092355154}, {"name": "gender", "weight": 0.08804661}, {"name": "transgender people", "weight": 0.08690758}, {"name": "additional genders", "weight": 0.08672367}, {"name": "male transgenders", "weight": 0.076095805}, {"name": "sex", "weight": 0.07453084}, {"name": "people", "weight": 0.06720095}, {"name": "other Americans", "weight": 0.064224415}, {"name": "ordinary Americans", "weight": 0.06389352}], "topics": [{"name": "LGBTQ"}, {"name": "Social Issues"}, {"name": "Trans Rights"}, {"name": "Polls"}], "categories": [{"name": "Health"}], "entities": [{"data": "Americans", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 8}, {"data": "Democrats", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Harvard/Harris", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 8}, {"data": "Public Religion Research Institute", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "PRRI", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 7}, {"data": "Breitbart News", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Google", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Facebook", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the American Principles Project", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Harris Insights and Analytics", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Barack Obama", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Glenn Youngkin\u2019s", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Twitter", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Virginia", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.04588778, "negative": 0.29083705, "neutral": 0.6632752}, "summary": "In 2019, the Harvard/Harris team asked 1,295 registered voters: \u201cDo you think that transgender people should be required to use the bathroom of their sex at birth or allowed to use the bathroom that best aligns with their gender identity and stated sex?\u201d\n\n However, most Democrats still support the claim that feelings of gender are more important than biology for purposes of classifying people in a complementary male-and-female society where less than one percent of people try to live as members of the opposite sex.

Her parents reportedly \u201ctried to dismiss the concept as being in her mind, but their efforts eventually turned out to be in vain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe medical advice given by the psychological doctors and endocrinologists at the hospital was to stabilize and improve her mood first and suppress her menstruation with medication to ease her anxiety. It is up to herself whether she wants surgery when she grows up,\u201d the Global Times reported.\n\nMedical and political acceptance of transgenderism is a very recent phenomenon in China, which would explain why most of the Global Times article is devoted to commentary and statistics on transgenderism in the United States.\n\nIn May 2019, Amnesty International (AI) found \u201cprevalent discrimination and stigma\u201d against transgender people in China, including from their own parents.\n\nThe AI report warned that Chinese transgender people were \u201cperforming highly dangerous surgery on themselves\u201d and \u201cbuying unsafe hormone treatments on the black market\u201d because few medical resources were available to them.\n\n\u201cIn China, transgender people are classed as having a \u2018mental illness\u2019 and gender-affirming surgeries require the consent of families. This is a major barrier in accessing safe treatment. Due to the fear of rejection, many transgender people choose not to tell their families,\u201d AI wrote.\n\nThe first person in China to openly undergo gender-changing surgery is 53-year-old TV host Jin Xing, a biological male who became \u201cChina\u2019s Oprah Winfrey\u201d after undergoing transition surgery in 1995.\n\nThe New York Times noted in July 2021 that Jin remains one of the few major gay or transgender celebrities in China. Jin\u2019s career success could be partly due to the persona of a conservative traditionalist who has \u201chounded female guests to hurry up and get married\u201d and have children, and encouraged women to attract a man by acting like \u201ca little girl who needs him.\u201d\n\nThese are messages the Chinese Communist Party wants to spread as it fights against a low-birth demographic death spiral, but apparently the Party lost interest in Jin Xing as a spokeswoman in 2017 when Jin\u2019s popular TV show was suddenly canceled for reasons that have never been explained.\n\nThe NYT quoted observers who thought the cancellation of Jin\u2019s show marked the beginning of a \u201cbroader government crackdown on gender-related activism,\u201d but after four years that crackdown might be ending as quickly and mysteriously as it began.\n\nLast month, Nikkei Asia profiled Huang Xi, a transgender lawyer, activist, and counselor who was born male but came out in 2017 after attending school in the United States and taking some inspiration from the career of Jin Xing.\n\nHuang noted China still lacks any legal classification for trans people and surgery is still very difficult to obtain. Parents are known to commit transgender children to involuntary psychiatric care when they come out.\n\nThe Chinese government continues to make no effort to count or estimate the size of its transgender population, although academic researchers have estimated a transgender rate of 0.28 percent, which would be about 4 million people given China\u2019s immense general population.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s necessary to resolve their traumatic experiences first before they can make decisions on their own about what\u2019s next,\u201d Huang said of the work performed by Huang\u2019s foundation, the Trans Well-Being Team, which conducts most of its activities online.\n\nThe opening of a transgender clinic in Shanghai, with approving coverage from Chinese state media, will surely be welcomed as a positive step by transgender Chinese. Another unexpected good omen arrived three weeks ago, when Jin Xing announced the return of the canceled talk show at a press conference also held in Shanghai.\n\n\u201cWhen the show was canceled, I said to myself that I needed to lay low and learn more. When the right moment came, I would then be able to talk about even more standout things that show my attitude,\u201d Jin said at the press conference.\n\nAccording to the Global Times, the reaction of Chinese \u201cnetizens\u201d was mostly positive, and their hyper-censorious government allowed them to be positive. The only skepticism reported by the Global Times came from social media commenters who thought Jin was \u201csometimes too radical.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsiders believe that the return of the show isn\u2019t significant for its \u2018radical\u2019 language, but more importantly because it shows the high tolerance the Chinese general public has toward the transgender community,\u201d the Global Times wrote. That high level of tolerance was considerably more difficult to detect just a few months ago.", "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Chinese transgender people", "weight": 0.08735193}, {"name": "transgender people", "weight": 0.085011415}, {"name": "Jin Xing", "weight": 0.080045395}, {"name": "transgender children", "weight": 0.079233244}, {"name": "many transgender people", "weight": 0.079214275}, {"name": "transgender Chinese", "weight": 0.07799927}, {"name": "Jin", "weight": 0.070347115}, {"name": "Global Times", "weight": 0.06855265}, {"name": "transition surgery", "weight": 0.06349307}, {"name": "China", "weight": 0.061907858}], "topics": [{"name": "Asia"}, {"name": "LGBTQ"}, {"name": "Social Issues"}, {"name": "Trans Rights"}], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "China", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 9}, {"data": "Shanghai", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "the United States", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Global Times", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 8}, {"data": "the Children\u2019s Hospital of Fudan University", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Amnesty International", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Party", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "NYT", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Nikkei Asia", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Communist", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Chinese", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Jin Xing", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 10}, {"data": "Oprah Winfrey", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Huang Xi", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 4}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.030232713, "negative": 0.46488526, "neutral": 0.50488204}, "summary": "China\u2019s state-run Global Times on Thursday announced the opening of the Communist country\u2019s \u201cfirst multidisciplinary clinic for transgender children and adolescents\u201d at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Fudan University in Shanghai.

Chris Stewart (R-UT) introduced a compromise bill, along with 20 Republican co-sponsors, that he says will protect religious liberty while \u201cbroadly\u201d providing protections for transgender individuals in public \u201caccommodations\u201d and \u201cemployment.\u201d\n\nIn a telephone interview Thursday with Breitbart News, Stewart said his federal Fairness for All Act is based on his state\u2019s Utah Compromise.\n\n\u201cBut, we knew that when we came to the federal side, it was going to be, you know, much harder to do than at the state level, and that it was going to take time to put a coalition together, and then time to get our Democrats involved,\u201d he said, elaborating on his thinking about whether Democrats will join in supporting the legislation.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s moving forward,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI think our Democratic colleagues were putting a lot of hope in the Equality Act. And I think they realize that\u2019s probably not going to go forward in the Senate. I think they also thought that the courts would be more friendly to them and I think they look at the Supreme Court and realize that\u2019s probably not true any longer. And, so, I think that opens up some, some of them towards looking at a compromise bill that can actually pass. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that we can continue to make progress on the Fairness for All.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News asked Stewart what he thought about current events in local school districts as American families from both parties have voiced concerns about the infiltration of LGBTQ activism in classrooms, women\u2019s sports, and in medicine \u2013 in terms of recent state bans against transgender treatments and surgeries for children.\n\nThe congressman described the Fairness for All legislation as \u201cbroader\u201d and \u201cmute\u201d on all these issues, leaving them to individual states and local communities to decide them.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at some of the things that are happening around the world, and especially in education around the country, in education, it\u2019s infuriating for any one of us who are social conservatives,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to remember too that the Fairness for All is not intended to address those issues. We are mute on those issues. We allow the states in the local communities to address those issues as they should. It\u2019s not our intention to address those issues. The Fairness for All is much more broad than that. Its purpose is to protect in housing and public accommodations and to protect religious liberty in doing that. And we leave all of these other issues to the local communities to the states as they should.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why states need a federal law that, as he said, is \u201cnot a federal mandate,\u201d that would push them to decide transgender rights and religious liberty issues for themselves, Stewart replied, \u201cIt would just be impossible for us to put legislation that would address all of those issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s far too many of them,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many variables that could come into play. We knew it would be impossible for us to address those, so this is just something we\u2019re trying to do that is much more broad, and actually something we could pass and once again, my primary motive in doing this is because of my fear that religious liberty is under threat.\u201d\n\nBut Jon Schweppe, who serves as Director of Policy and Government Affairs at American Principles Project, wrote at his Substack column Tuesday that Stewart\u2019s bill is yet another example of Republicans believing they should \u201csnatch defeat from the jaws of victory.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by Breitbart News how a school principal, a teacher, a pediatrician, or an employer could be accused of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d on the basis of gender identity if the Fairness for All bill would become law, Stewart responded, \u201cWell, again, I don\u2019t think we address that specifically, we don\u2019t talk about a high school or a leader of a, you know, local school community.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is language in there which codifies the definition of transgender,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, for example, it doesn\u2019t allow someone who can put on a skirt in the morning and say, I\u2019m a transgender today, and I\u2019m therefore going to use the women\u2019s rest room today.\u201d\n\nStewart stressed the bill\u2019s requirement for private spaces for young people.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s privacy for everyone, regardless of their sex,\u201d he stated, noting the definition of \u201ctransgender\u201d in the bill is \u201cto be provided by evidence of, including medical history, care of treatment of gender identity, consistent and uniform assertion of gender identity, or other evidence that the gender identity is sincerely held.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, in other words, the person who is conveniently identifying as transgendered wouldn\u2019t be protected under this legislation,\u201d he asserted.\n\nThe Fairness for All Act and its model legislation, the Utah Compromise of 2015, has been criticized by conservatives as still creating protected classes of people based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and by the left as a \u201cdangerous LGBT Trojan horse\u201d that does not provide special protections for transgender individuals due to its religious liberty carveouts.\n\nRyan Anderson, Ph.D., now president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, wrote at the Heritage Foundation in 2017 the concept of \u201cFairness for All\u201d is \u201cfundamentally misguided\u201d:\n\nThe most prominent model for creating specific LGBT policies while showing concern for religious freedom is known as \u201cFairness for All,\u201d a phrase used by proponents to describe a law first adopted in Utah and similar proposals in other states and potentially at the national level. This approach creates new protected classes in antidiscrimination law based on sexual orientation and gender identity and then grants limited exemptions and protections, mainly to religious organizations. Proponents of \u201cFairness for All\u201d do not argue the need for sexual orientation and gender identity laws robustly, with facts and studies, and thus elide the question of whether that need requires SOGI [sexual orientation and gender identity] laws to address it as opposed to some less drastic measure or measures.\n\nIn 2016, Anderson joined Princeton University Professor Robert George in a piece at the Witherspoon Institute\u2019s Public Discourse in which the two scholars mapped out how liberty and SOGI laws are an \u201cimpossible and unsustainable \u2018compromise.\u2019\u201d\n\nCompromise bills such as the one adopted in Utah actually \u201cdo not protect fairness for all,\u201d and \u201cdo not establish a compromise,\u201d Anderson and George argued.\n\nFairness for All measures \u201cestablish the principle that sexual orientation (and gender identity) should be protected classes like race,\u201d and subsequently support the notion that beliefs that men and women are biologically distinct are \u201cirrational and unjust,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe press release from Stewart\u2019s office states the Fairness for All Act is backed by the Alliance for Lasting Liberty Coalition, consisting of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, American Unity Fund, Center for Public Justice, 1st Amendment Partnership, The Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Council for Christian Colleges & Universities, and others.\n\nRepublican cosponsors of the legislation are: Rep.

It involves speaking and interacting with that person in an untruthful manner.\u201d\n\n \u201cThe faithful should avoid using \u2018gender-affirming\u2019 terms or pronouns that convey approval of or reinforce the person\u2019s rejection of the truth,\u201d Burbidge writes. \u201cIt is not harsh or judgmental to decline to use such language.\u201d\n\nIn point of fact, he insists: \u201cNo one \u2018is\u2019 transgender.

We stand ready to use children as enforcers. We want children to rat out their parents and their teachers. They cannot trust the adults who are part of their lives, such as their teachers or pastors. They cannot trust the people who gave them life, their parents. We want every child to see us and us alone, as their savior and protector.\n\nAddressing transgender students in the video are Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke for the Civil Rights Division, Department of Education Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Suzanne Goldberg, and Department of Health and Human Services, and Assistant Secretary for Health Dr. Rachel Levine, formerly Richard Levine.\n\nGoldberg begins by empathizing with students who might experience some anxiety about returning to school:\n\nBut Goldberg then specifically addresses transgender students, honing in on whether they will feel they belong, and whether they will be \u201csafe\u201d:\n\nClarke begins her address by acknowledging \u201cmany\u201d schools seek to give all students safe and welcoming environments, \u201cincluding LGBTQ students.\u201d\n\nViewers of the video can presume Clarke\u2019s reference to \u201csupportive and life-saving care\u201d is a reference to what LGBTQ activists and their allies in the transgender medical industry and the government refer to as \u201cgender-affirming\u201d care, i.e., puberty-blocking drugs, cross-sex hormones, and, ultimately, disfiguring surgeries such as double elective mastectomies.\n\nGoldberg then returns to instruct transgender students that, if they do not feel supported, \u201cthe Department of Education and the entire federal government stand behind you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Department of Justice is here, along with the Department of Education, to investigate complaints about discrimination or harassment based on sexual orientation or gender identity,\u201d Clarke returns to say. \u201cWe want you to know that we are looking out for you, and we\u2019re here to protect your civil rights.\u201d\n\nFinally, Levine follows up with warnings to transgender students they are likely to experience \u201cbullying and harassment.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is critical to support trans youth, their parents and families to help them achieve the good health and well-being that everyone deserves,\u201d Levine adds, implying that \u201ctrans youth\u201d will not achieve \u201cgood health\u201d until they are supported in their desire for life-altering drugs and surgeries.\n\nIn 2017, Levine actually recommended \u201caccelerating\u201d cross-sex hormones for homeless teens who are suffering from gender dysphoria while they are estranged from their parents.\n\nIn an address titled \u201cIt\u2019s a Transgeneration: Issues in Transgender Medicine,\u201d Levine asserted that those in the transgender medical industry who are seeing gender dysphoric teens from the \u201cstreet,\u201d living in homeless shelters, should not go through the usual procedure of first administering puberty blockers to stop normal puberty, but instead immediately prescribe cross-sex hormones.\n\nLevine told listeners that homeless teens who say they are transgender have been \u201cessentially thrown out by their parents because of their gender identity and expression.\u201d\n\nIn the current video, Goldberg and Clarke then remind transgender students of the \u201cmany federal government resources for you,\u201d and proceed to instruct them how to file complaints with the Departments of Education and Justice.\n\nClarke launches into attacks against states, like West Virginia, that have protected women\u2019s sports by banning transgender athletes, and some, like Arkansas, where lawmakers voted to override the governor\u2019s veto and ban transgender medical interventions for minors.\n\nClarke assures transgender students the federal government is on their side.\n\n\u201cRight now, we are fighting against laws that tried to ban transgender athletes in West Virginia and deny health care for transgender young people in Arkansas,\u201d she states. \u201cAnd recently federal courts in both states have blocked those laws from being applied.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Biden sent an unequivocal message to the transgender community,\u201d Levine goes on to say, quoting Biden:\n\n\u201cI want all of you to know that I have your back too, and I will do everything that I can to support and advocate for our community,\u201d Levine adds, clearly identifying with the transgender young people.\n\nMorse asks the question, \u201cWho exactly \u2026 is likely to file a complaint?\u201d given the fact that many students who \u201ccome out\u201d as \u201ctrans\u201d at school are showered with attention and support.\n\n\u201cOne thing is for sure: The Sexual State will not allow parents, states and localities to make their own decisions, pass their own laws, or adapt to the wishes of their own people,\u201d Morse concludes. \u201cThe Sexual State, captured by ideologues, is here to

Clarke launches into attacks against states, like West Virginia, that have protected women\u2019s sports by banning transgender athletes, and some, like Arkansas, where lawmakers voted to override the governor\u2019s veto and ban transgender medical interventions for minors. \u201cRight now, we are fighting against laws that tried to ban transgender athletes in West Virginia and deny health care for transgender young people in Arkansas,\u201d she states.", "translation": "", "locations": [], "reprint": false, "authorsByline": "Dr. Susan Berry", "articleId": "3f4ff7f60320427c96364fef3ad39dbe", "clusterId": "69a3051356de4ef9af6afeae7b390076", "imageUrl": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/05/Pennsylvania-Health-Secretary-Rachel-Levine-CBS-Philly-YouTube-640x335.jpg", "pubDate": "2021-08-26T22:07:42+00:00", "addDate": "2021-08-27T00:18:57.328192+00:00", "refreshDate": "2021-08-27T00:18:57.328192+00:00", "matchedAuthors": []}, {"url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/08/25/mosque-bomber-asks-judge-acknowledge-he-is-transgender-woman/", "source": {"domain": "breitbart.com"}, "country": "us", "language": "en", "title": "Mosque Bomber Asks Judge to Acknowledge He Is a \u2018Transgender\u2019 Woman", "description": "Mosque Bomber Asks Judge to Acknowledge He Is a \u2018Transgender\u2019 Woman  Breitbart", "content": "The man who is facing life in prison for masterminding the 2017 attack on a Minnesota mosque is now claiming he is a transgender \u201cwoman\u201d and has asked a court to recognize his \u201cgender identity.\u201d\n\nMichael Hari, 50, is asking to be called Emily Claire Hari and said gender dysphoria and \u201cright-wing misinformation\u201d is to blame for fueling the bombing of the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington, Minnesota.\n\nThe Star Tribune reported on the bizarre development, including claiming his \u201cgender identity\u201d is reason to reduce his prison sentence:\n\n\u201cShe strongly desired making a full transition but knew she would be ostracized from everyone and everything she knew,\u201d Hari\u2019s defense attorney, Shannon Elkins, wrote in court documents. \u201cThus, as she formed a ragtag group of freedom fighters or militia men and spoke of missions to Cuba and Venezuela, Ms. Hari secretly looked up \u2018sex change,\u2019 \u2018transgender surgery,\u2019 and \u2018post-op transgender\u2019 on the Internet. As she purchased military fatigues for their \u2018missions\u2019 she also purchased dresses and female clothing for a planned trip to Bangkok, Thailand, for male-to-female surgery. She was living a double life.\u201d Elkins cites these as factors in asking U.S. District Judge Donovan Frank to give Hari no more than a 30-year prison sentence \u2014 the mandatory minimum for Hari\u2019s conviction \u2014 and not the life term sought by prosecutors. She has also asked for an amended prison placement based on her transgender identity, but the details of the request are under seal. Elkins could not be reached for comment. In December, a jury found Hari, of Clarence, Ill., guilty on civil rights and hate crimes charges related to bombing the mosque. Throughout the 2 \u00bd-week trial in St. Paul, prosecutors for Minnesota\u2019s U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office described Hari as a hater of Islam and immigrants who viewed both as threats to American culture. After the 2016 election of Donald Trump, Hari bid on a federal government contract to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall, which Hari viewed as a symbol of protecting American values. Hari later graduated to violent action, manipulating uneducated and financially vulnerable men from Hari\u2019s rural community to help \u201charass the untouchables.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 4, 2017 Hari, Joe Morris, and Michael McWhorter drove a rented pickup truck filled with assault rifles, a sledgehammer, and a 20-pound black powder bomb from Illinois to Minnesota to attack the mosque.\n\n\u201cDuring the trial, Morris and McWhorter told the jury that, under Hari\u2019s instructions, they broke open a window to the mosque and tossed the bomb into the imam\u2019s office as people gathered inside for a morning prayer,\u201d the Tribune reported. \u201cHari supervised from the truck, and all three slapped a high-five as they sped away. Morris and McWhorter both pleaded guilty to their roles in the bombing and became key witnesses for the prosecution\u2019s case against Hari.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe property damage was collateral to [Hari\u2019s] real purpose,\u201d prosecutors said in arguing for a life sentence. \u201cThis bomb \u2014 the defendant\u2019s bomb \u2014 was an act of terror intended to destroy the heart of a community.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmily Hari is more than a one-note caricature,\u201d Elkins said in the Tribune report. \u201cShe is a complex human being who has been convicted by a jury of her peers. She will stand before this Court for sentencing, facing life in prison. She asks the Court to consider a sentence that is just and proportionate rather than vindictive or symbolic.\u201d\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.com.", "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Hari", "weight": 0.093808785}, {"name": "Ms. Hari", "weight": 0.092157245}, {"name": "Emily Hari", "weight": 0.09162155}, {"name": "Michael Hari", "weight": 0.091133595}, {"name": "Emily Claire Hari", "weight": 0.08674144}, {"name": "transgender surgery", "weight": 0.07953542}, {"name": "Minnesota", "weight": 0.06549072}, {"name": "prison", "weight": 0.05955389}, {"name": "gender dysphoria", "weight": 0.059120357}, {"name": "American culture", "weight": 0.057937946}], "topics": [{"name": "LGBTQ"}, {"name": "Social Issues"}, {"name": "Trans Rights"}], "categories": [{"name": "Politics"}], "entities": [{"data": "the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center", "type": "FAC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Michael Hari", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 15}, {"data": "Elkins", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Joe Morris", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Michael McWhorter", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Emily Claire Hari", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Shannon Elkins", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Donovan Frank", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Donald Trump", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Penny Starr", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Tribune", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Court", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "The Star Tribune", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "U.S.-Mexico", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "a morning", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Twitter", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Minnesota", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "U.S.", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Bloomington", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Cuba", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Venezuela", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Bangkok", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Thailand", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Clarence", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ill.", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "St. Paul", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Illinois", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "American", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Islam", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.032608252, "negative": 0.5046139, "neutral": 0.46277788}, "summary": "\n\nMichael Hari, 50, is asking to be called Emily Claire Hari and said gender dysphoria and \u201cright-wing misinformation\u201d is to blame for fueling the bombing of the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington, Minnesota. \u201cThus, as she formed a ragtag group of freedom fighters or militia men and spoke of missions to Cuba and Venezuela, Ms. Hari secretly looked up \u2018sex change,\u2019 \u2018transgender surgery,\u2019 and \u2018post-op transgender\u2019 on the Internet.

You\u2019re not a woman.

Their argument claims that children and adults should be allowed to change their legal sex by simply declaring an opposite-sex \u201cgender identity,\u201d even without behavioral changes or cosmetic surgery.\n\nThe far-reaching demand would require the subordination of Americans who recognize the biological basis of the two sexes, and the wholesale transformation of male-female relations in many areas of civic life, including romance, child-rearing, sports, civic associations, and language.\n\nIn June, for example, the establishment media ignored the argument made by an American woman who was appalled when a naked man was allowed into a women\u2019s spa in Los Angeles:\n\nSimilarly, the establishment media ignored a woman\u2019s speech outside the Supreme Court in 2019, who argued that the transgender claim threatens children:\n\nIt is the right of all women to speak publicly and be able to petition our government for the redress of our grievances and be able to participate openly in the public sphere. I have seen numerous women banned from social media for pointing out that gender transition treatments leave children sterile for life at ages where they can\u2019t possibly consent to such permanent decisions. But a generation of quirky, stereotype-rejecting kids \u2014 many of whom would grow up to identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual, many of whom are autistic \u2014 are being sterilized as minors now.\n\nThe \u201ctransgender\u201d label includes several disparate categories of people who want to live as members of the other sex.\n\nThe categories include young people who reject puberty in the increasingly chaotic dating culture, and the normal tomboys pushed to declare themselves as transgender boys. The categories include gays and lesbians who try to reconcile relationship conflicts, as well as young people who undergo extensive transformation to mimic members of the opposite sex.\n\nThe most important transgender group are the older and often high-testosterone heterosexual men who are sexually entranced by images of themselves as women. This viewpoint is dubbed \u201cautogynephilia.\u201d\n\nMany progressives are eager to endorse the transgender movement, partly because progressives believe that government should help people escape curbs on their freedom, including biological limits.\n\nBut a lopsided majority of ordinary Americans, conservatives, left-wingers, progressives, and gays oppose the transgender ideology.\n\nIn November 2019, Canadian author Meghan Murphy spoke at a Toronto library about the transgender threat to women\u2019s rights, while hundreds of pro-transgender protestors tried to block the event:\n\nThis is unacceptable. Women have the right to speak about their sex based rights and to discuss valid concerns about the impact of men identifying as women on their safety. This trans activist movement \u2014 this gender identity ideology \u2014 is nothing if not an absolutely regressive, irrational, anti-woman movement that appears to have become incredibly authoritarian, as no one is allowed to question, challenge, or disagree. And those who do, like myself, are threatened with just about every social and physical punishment imaginable \u2014 jail, social ostracization, loss of income, violence, even death. It is insanity. Even more so when you consider that it is those of us simply trying to speak \u2014 to have a conversation \u2014 to ask pivotal questions about laws and ideas and policies that impact our lives and the lives of others \u2014 who are accused of \u201cbigotry,\u201d \u201cfascism,\u201d and \u201cviolence.\u201d The reversals boggle the mind. And the government and the media have completely failed women on this issue. The entire language of the trans activist movement has taken up the erasure of women in order to accommodate a tiny minority of people who would like us all to pretend that material reality doesn\u2019t exist. We are no longer women, but \u2018cis women\u2019, which means, supposedly, we are women who \u2018identify with the gender assigned to us at birth\u2019. This is insulting. I am not a woman [simply] because I identify with femininity. Femininity refers to the set of stereotypes imposed on women in a patriarchal society. I do not identify with those stereotypes. I am not passive, irrational, or over emotional. I am not a woman because I wear makeup or high heels. My long hair does not make me a woman. If I were currently in sweatpants and sneakers, if I shaved my head and went makeupless and took up football, I\u2019d still be a woman.\n\nThe risks include the health risks from drugs, hormones, and surgery, the sexual and social isolation of people who claim to be transgender, and the refusal to recognize the non-transgender sources of teenagers\u2019 distress. Many children are damaged by elite-touted transgender claims, including Jazz Jennings, a boy who had his penis amputated in 2019.\n\nPolls show the public rejects the transgender demands, especially of transgender medical interventions in kids.", "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "transgender women", "weight": 0.11314684}, {"name": "Women", "weight": 0.08656757}, {"name": "women", "weight": 0.08656757}, {"name": "Transgender activists", "weight": 0.08466474}, {"name": "transgender activists", "weight": 0.08466474}, {"name": "transgender boys", "weight": 0.083874986}, {"name": "numerous women", "weight": 0.08269061}, {"name": "pro-transgender protestors", "weight": 0.078105636}, {"name": "transgender medical interventions", "weight": 0.07680384}, {"name": "men", "weight": 0.05950655}], "topics": [{"name": "LGBTQ"}, {"name": "Social Issues"}, {"name": "Trans Rights"}], "categories": [{"name": "Health"}], "entities": [{"data": "Don Sucher", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Meghan Murphy", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Jazz Jennings", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Americans", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Canadian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Los Angeles", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Toronto", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Supreme Court", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.020190928, "negative": 0.70716107, "neutral": 0.27264804}, "summary": "The transgender man insisted he is a woman, by repeating \u201ctransgender women are women.\u201d The transgender dispute is rarely argued out in public, partly because the establishment media rarely challenges claims by transgender activists.\n\n \n\nIn November 2019, Canadian author Meghan Murphy spoke at a Toronto library about the transgender threat to women\u2019s rights, while hundreds of pro-transgender protestors tried to block the event:\n\nThis is unacceptable.
